O BJECTIVES     Understand the tasks that are performed by an associate     Understand the tasks that are performed by an administrator     Use the checklists to keep track of the sub-tasks identified for each activity  O VERVIEW  The Accounts Payable module will provide several resources to manage the cash outflow for your institution.  You can track your vendor and invoice information by assigning a subsidiary to each vendor. A subsidiary is a group of individual balances that are associated with a particular General Ledger (control) account. The sum of all subsidiaries will equal the balance of the control account; therefore, you will need to identify these General Ledger accounts with a subsidiary code.

Modify address and  due date  If the default vendor address that has already been assigned to the invoice needs to change, you can simply override the vendor address since the invoice has already been posted.  By changing the due date of an invoice, you can remove it from the check run which will impact the cash outflow.  Print checks or  generate ACH  electronic payments  After the invoices are selected, you can print checks   – you may want to review them before approving and accepting the check run.  Print a single  immediate check  When paying one specific invoice, you may want to print one single check immediately.  Enter a single  manual check  There may be rare situations when a blank manual check, written outside of the system, needs to be generated.  Although this practice is not recommended, you can do so and then enter the manual check back into the system once the receipt or check stub is returned to the Accounts Payable office.

Remember that voiding a check is not the same a deleting a check   – a check that has been voided remains in the system indicating that no funds left the bank when it was issued.  Delete cleared  checks  You may find it necessary to delete very old checks in order to improve performance issues encountered when reconciling checking accounts.  Do not delete checks if they are less than 5 years old and only when performance is a significant problem since losing an audit trail of check is not a recommended practice.  Managing Vendor Records  Proper vendor management will assist in efficiently processing invoices and cash disbursements.  Create or update  vendor profiles  Before an invoice can be issued, the vendor must exist in the EX system.  You can establish certain defaults (such as shipping terms and account numbers) in each vendor profile so that invoice entry will be easier.

This information is also useful for auditors in order to  determine if any financial problems exist at your institution or if any  payables need to be written off because they are in dispute and will never  be paid.  Filing Government Forms  Vendors who are not incorporated will need to report income received to the federal government on a 1099 form. Several forms are supported with the EX software   –   specifically, 1099Int, 1099Misc, 1099Q, and 1099R. Transactions can be identified to appear within any boxes on these supported forms and will automatically be totaled at the end of the year to be printed on the correct form.  Review 1099 totals   Before actually filing your 1099s with the government, you may find it helpful to view a report of all vendor activity for the calendar year.

You can define subsidiaries in Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable   –   once a subsidiary exists in one module, it will be available in both modules. An Accounts Payable subsidiary can track the detailed transactions and total amount that is owed to each vendor while an Accounts Receivable subsidiary tracks every kind of transaction except those that fall into the Accounts Payable category such as deferred income or liability accounts.  In order for the SB transactions to post to the desired Cash account, you need to create a separate subsidiary using the same general ledger account specified for the SB prefix. In this case, you may also need to designate a unique AP account.

While vendors can have more than one electronic payment record, the dates for each  record cann ot overlap each other.  Vendors generally issue credit memos rather than refund checks to their customers. However, on occasion, you may receive a refund check from a vendor.  Vendor refund checks should be recorded in the system using a Refund Invoice   –   in this way, the invoice will correct the total amounts paid to the vendor. If you use a feature in another Business Office module (such as the A/R Receipting function), the vendor totals will no longer be correct in the A/P Master table.

The editable fields will allow you to make changes to this specific information that exists on the Invoice Header table.  If you would like to delay payment of an invoice, change the Invoice Payable Date at  the bottom of the window.  An invoice cannot be deleted once it has been posted. However, you can use one of the following methods to remove a posted invoice:     Use a future date for the invoice so that the Checks Electronic Payments To Be Issued Report will not capture it within the criteria  o   Remember that the future date must be greater than the date entered in the   Ending Date for Checks to be Written   field on the Checks To Be Issued Report     Issue a credit

In most cases, you will want to generate the aging report at the end of each month to help you identify potential cash flow problems.  1   Open the   A/P Aging  Report   window  2   Choose a title for the report  3   Select a subsidiary group for  which the report will be  generated  4   Enter the aging date (that is, the starting date for aging your invoices)  o   For example, as illustrated above, the A/P aging date of 11/01/2008 has been chosen; therefore, if you have identified an aging period as 0-30 days, any unpaid invoice with a transaction date between 10/2/08 and 11/01/2008 will be included within the 0-30 day aging category  5   Select posted and un-posted or only posted transactions  6   Sort by name or ID number  7   Choose to preview the print or print immediately EX

Scenario A  Using the two illustrations above, if you would like to print checks on 12/28/2008 for all invoices that are payable up through and including 12/31/2008, do the following:  1   Enter 3/19/2012 in the   Invoices Scheduled to be Paid on or Before   field on the   Select Invoices for Payment   window  2   Enter 3/19/2012 in the   Date to be on Check   field on the   Checks To Be Issued Report  window  If you receive a message that no invoices have been found, this indicates that no eligible invoices are payable on or before 12/31/2008 due to one of the following reasons:  

In this situation, the best recommendation is to keep credit card and check transactions completely separated by creating a parallel structure.  The steps below can be used as a guideline for the credit card structure. For the purpose of this illustration, the CC (Credit Card) code will be used as an example.  1   Create a new CC Subsidiary Group  2   Create a new CC Subsidiary Definition  3   Create a new CC Check Prefix  4   Group the Subsidiary Definition beneath the Subsidiary Group  5   Add the Subsidiary Definition to every vendor record that is to be paid by credit card (referred to as the Subsidiary Code on the Vendor window)  6   Enter invoices and select the CC Subsidiary Code  7   When generating the Checks To Be Issued Report, select the CC Subsidiary Group and   the CC Check Prefix EX Accounts

the Check Register  9   Respond to the prompt that the checks have printed successfully and post the DB group as usual  When performing Steps 1 through 3, you will need to decide whether to use your existing bank account number, GL cash account and GL payable account, or create new accounts on the general ledger.  Remember that the Checks   To Be Issued Report will be tagging invoices based  on the Subsidiary Group   –   not the Subsidiary Code. Therefore, if you were to  classify the AP and CC Subsidiary Codes under the single AP Subsidiary Group,  the two categories of invoices will be combined o n the CTBI Report.

The decision regarding the vendors who must receive the 1099 form regardless of the transaction amount is best made by the business office staff   –   therefore, you can always be sure that the setting selected on the Required Govt Forms tab will always be honored.  Scenario A     Staples has been identified with the 1099 Misc form on the Required Govt Forms tab     You have customized your query to only select vendors with more than $600 in transactions     John's Paper Supply does not have transactions exceeding $600  In this case, you can deselect the   Create Form   checkbox in Step 2 of the wizard and proceed to Step 5 where the vendor will be skipped during the form printing process.  Although you can also delete the form from the vendor record, this is not a recommended practice since you will need to add the row again if the vendor needs the form at another time.
