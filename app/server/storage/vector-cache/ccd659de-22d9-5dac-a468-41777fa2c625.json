In EX 5.5, the process was automated so that it runs automatically on a 1 - 5 minute  interval. As a result, you only need to formally run it, when:     You’ve recently synchronized advisees and want the same population’s student  progress data recomputed without having to wait the 5 minutes     You’ve recently made a change to an individual student’s aims or student progress  data (via an Advising Alteration), and again want the data recomputed without  having to wait the 5 minutes     You’re trying to capture fresh student course needs data to be summed by the  Compute Course Needs process, for course forecasting (i.e. how many students will  need course XYZ, therefore how many sections do we need to offer) © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.

customize the query to run the process for a select population  •   The <Original> query pulls all students who have at least one row in the STUD_AIMS table (i.e. any/all  students who have aims)  
