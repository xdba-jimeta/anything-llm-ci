June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Trouble Shoot and walk through various scenarios early and often.  •   We hard coded the tool to load stage 204 and only stage 204.  •   We did not expect the vendors to change column formats every year.     Make it adaptable..  •   “Sheet1”.....  •   Success breeds an expansion of tasks. “Since you can upload names....”     Other Vendors (College Board, GoFish)     Bar Code scanners     Expanded purchases beyond 12 th   grade (transfers, 11 th   , 10 th     Make it simple and document your processes.  •   We started out using this twice a year. We had to relearn our process every time.  A few lessons learned before moving on © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Create your Profile in the Import Utility  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Create your Profile in the Import Utility  •   Used:   The   Used   column can specify whether or not the named column is actually used in the Import Utility. If a column is marked as not used (unselected), it will be ignored in all procedures and also will not be available to compare the outside data source with the EX database.  •   Required:   Select the   Required   check box if you wish to ensure that a particular piece of data exists in the IU table(s) before doing the import into the EX tables. If the required data does not exist, the Import Utility will produce an error upon upload of the data.  •   Dup Search:   The   Duplicate   check box can be used to specify if the named column should be included in the search for duplicate records. Therefore, if you want to check for a duplicate in the  Address Line 1   column of the   Address Master table , you would select the   Duplicate   check box.

June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Check to make sure your profile is loaded. If it’s not then load it.  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Time to Check your Data  The import form start to finish  Even though you have done everything you can think of to prepare your file, there may still be an error.  Example: We were trying to load high schools that did not exist in our database. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Time to check for duplicates in the EX database. (NOT YOUR UPLOAD)  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Depending on the number of duplicates found, either handle them in the import utility or leave Jenzabar.     Normally there are enough to leave Jenzabar and use some infomaker reports.     Note that I said “infomaker”. Yes, these tables are accessible for queries.  •   They all start with “IU”  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Don’t forget we are working in the PLAY database at this point....switch your infomaker db profile.     We have built a specific pbl and queries for this process.  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  SELECT iu_name.temp_id,  candidate.id_num,  iu_name.last_name as 'IU_LNAME',  iu_name.first_name as 'IU_FNAME',  NAME_AND_ADDRESS.LAST_NAME as 'DB_LName',  NAME_AND_ADDRESS.FIRST_NAME as 'DB_FNAME',  iu_address.addr_line_1 as 'IU_ADDR1',  name_and_address.addr_line_1 as 'DB_ADDR1',  iu_address.addr_line_2 as 'IU_ADDR2',  name_and_address.addr_line_2 as 'DB_ADDR2',  iu_address.CITY as 'IU_City',  name_and_address.CITY as 'DB_City',  iu_address.STATE as 'IU_state',  name_and_address.STATE as 'DB_State',  iu_address.ZIP as 'IU_Zip',  name_and_address.ZIP as 'DB_Zip',  The import form start to finish  IU_NAME.EMAIL_ADDRESS as 'IU_EMAIL',  NAME_AND_ADDRESS.EMAIL_ADDRESS as 'DB_EMAIL',  IU_CANDIDATE.CUR_PROG as 'IU_Prog',  Candidate.CUR_PROG as 'DB_Prog',  candidate.cur_yr,  candidate.cur_trm,  candidate.cur_stage,  candidate.source_1,  candidate.source_dte_1  FROM candidate,  iu_duplicates,  iu_name,  name_and_address,  iu_address,  iu_candidate  WHERE ( iu_duplicates.temp_id = iu_name.temp_id ) and  ( iu_duplicates.id_num = candidate.id_num ) and  ( candidate.id_num = name_and_address.id_num ) and  ( iu_name.temp_id = iu_address.temp_id ) and  (IU_DUPLICATES.TEMP_ID = IU_CANDIDATE.TEMP_ID) © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Cleaning up the Duplicates  The import form start to finish     Color code and sort them. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Cleaning up the Duplicates cont.     Issues to consider.  •   Which data is more accurate and therefore should be kept?  •   Is it worth even uploading the new row from the import file?     Next, Remove the duplicates not worth dealing with from your import file.  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Reset the “Play” database and repeat all of the previous steps.     Now, the duplicate list should be much smaller.     Deal with each duplicate individually.     If you choose not update the original file, An option is “Clear the duplicates” and run the duplicate check again.  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Next, determine if Bobby Jo (coming from the outside source) is a different person than the one who is represented by ID Number 937 in the EX database. To insert the information as a new name, remove the row from the   Duplicates   tab using the 'Not Match' option in the   Action   drop-down list and save the changes on the   Duplicates   tab in preparation for the upload step.  Last, determine the set of information that is the most current: EX system, the outside source, or some combination of the two.  If the EX system information is most up to date, you can leave this row on the Duplicates table with either a 'Y' (Found) or \" (Not Found) in all of the table-name columns for the row; it will not be uploaded into your EX database.  If the outside source is most up to date, you need to update the system with the new information. To do this, you can either select the 'M' (Match) option from the   Action   drop-down list to set all of the table-name columns to 'M' (Merge) or you can manually change the individual table-name columns to 'M' (Merge) to indicate that the data in the IU tables should overwrite the existing data.  If the outside source contains some more recent information but you wish to keep some of the existing EX system information, you can choose on a table-by-table basis the data to import. For the tables you wish to leave as is, ensure that the corresponding table- name column has a 'Y' (Found) or \" (Not Found) specified. For the tables where you want to use the outside source's data, select the 'M' (Merge) option to indicate that the data in the corresponding IU table should be merged into the EX table. Note that the   Merge  option will insert a new row if no row already exits, and it will overwrite an existing row with whatever data is n the IU table.  From the EX help files © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Your ready to test your import.     Get some coffee...It may take awhile.  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     If the test run goes without errors, you’re ready to run it in production.     Repeat all of the previous steps but in the production database.     You will still need to check for duplicates and tell the utility what to do with them.  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Now that you have successfully loaded the data into the production database you probably think that you are done....and you will most likely be mistaken.     Do you have additional info to load that was not supported by the Import Utility.     Sports     Interest level     A consultant scoring result     How do you identify the students ID_Num and match it to your original file????  The import form start to finish © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     We have built infomaker queries that concatenate key fields.  •   Select Name_and_address.first_name + last_name + email_address as ‘test’,  name_and_address.id_num  Where stage_date > yesterday     We then do the same with the original data file in excel.  •   CONCATENATE(F2,M2,N2)     Then we use an excel lookup formula to add the  ID Number to the orginial file.     SQL inserts or manual input can then be used.  •   We use a mail merge to generate data entry cards for some.  Almost there © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Action Lists: do you need to remove an action list from the stage configuration.  •   When you run the import if you add or change a stage it will load the action list.  •   For the bar code files we receive from VACRAO we do not. (Usually under 100 names)  •   For purchase names we do. (usually over 1000)     What if we made a mistake like load the wrong counselor.  •   Been there don that on a list of over 10,000 names.  •   Because we have the id numbers, we can determine who the correct counselor is and insert the correction.     Once you learn how it works and run it successfully a few times, it seems less and less like a monster and more like a useful tool.
