The NSC reporting tools within the  Jenzabar EX product are the   preferred tools for accomplishing this task.   The NSC process   produces a data file of  all active students for a particular term. The data is sent via FTP to the National Student Clearinghouse. The  purpose of the report is to verify student's enrollment status for third party constituents such as banks, potential  employers, and other entities as well as provide enrollment data to the Department of Education and NSLDS.  The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) is the U.S. Department of Education's (ED's) central database  for student aid. NSLDS receives data from schools, guaranty agencies, the Direct Loan program, and other  Department of ED programs.  Preconditions  -   The individual needing access to the NSC Reporting tools must be a Jenzabar user with permissions and  appropriate knowledge to utilize the tool set. Familiarization with the toolset, and practice utilizing the  tool set within the play database are mandatory preconditions.  -   NSC   Upload   Data must be reported on an established timeline submitted to The National Student  Clearinghouse ( http://studentclearinghouse.org/ ).   The Registrar and several Registrar Office personnel  should have access to the secure portion of the NSC website. Permissions and roles are available at  http://studentclearinghouse.org/ .  -   While many errors may be corrected via the NSC website, NSC recommends and it is   best practice, to  correct the errors prior to submission . If you do not correct errors in the Jenzabar EX system, you will  need to correct the same errors every time you submit data to NSC. INSTRUCTIONS  There are several departments and divisions on the RCC campus, each utilizing the same data from the Jenzabar  EX database. “Clean” data is essential to ensure that faculty have the necessary information in order to advise  students, financial aid is awarded and distributed correctly, students are billed correctly, data is reported to  various local, state and federal entities in an accurate and timely manner, etc. Therefore, each   functional area  will be responsible for maintaining and correcting errors in their own data .   Numerous reports have been  created and compiled into “Buckets” or aggregate reports.   A “Team Leader” will be assigned to run the   Bucket  report on   a   designated schedule and ensure the data is corrected in a prompt and accurate manner.   Running  and acting on these reports may initially be daunting, however   within a short period of time   it will consume no  more than a few minutes per week.   See Table 1 below.

This report lists all  NSC data quality  issues that must  be corrected by  the Continuing  Education team.   It  is the complete  listing of data  quality issues  owned by the  Continuing  Education Team.  This is mainly  checking NC vs.  UG divisions ,  classes   and  maintaining the  non - degree  seeking indicator.  This report lists  ALL   NSC data  quality issues. It is  the oversight  report for use by  th e Registrar's  office. It is a roll -  up report   of all  previous   NSC  reports . All  reports and   issues  are aggregated  i nto a single view  and ordered by  student ID  number.   The  Registrar will  ensure the data is  in acceptable  format and is  accurate.  Table 1 FINDING YOUR REPORTS  You will find the necessary reports on your Jenzabar   My Workspace   “Home” screen. You most likely will not see  the same shared reports as what is pictured below, however you will have access and the ability to run   your  necessary reports, based on your position and permissions . See Figure 1.   The following pages will include a  direct link to all available reports.  Figure 1   –   Jenzabar “My Workspace”  Available Reports  Home Screen Admission Data Quality Reports  The Admission Office should run the following report   at the end of each day   to ensure that all data is  accurate and   up - to - date as this office is the first to work with student data.   All data should be  corrected before the AD to RE process is run.   The report is located here:  http://report.rcc.mass.edu/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fJenzabar+EX+Reports%2fReports%2fDash  boards%2fExecutive+Dashboard%2fRegistration%2fData+QC%2fNSC_All_Probs_By_Student_ADM_Bucket&Vie  wMode=Detail  COMMON ERROR MESSAGES AND CORRECTIVE ACTION:  Missing Citizen Of Attribute [Biograph_Master].[CITIZEN_OF].  Or  Missing Social Security Number [Biograph_Master].[SSN].  Figure 2   –   Maintain Candidacy Window  Access the “Maintain Candidacy” screen in the   AD   Module.   See F igure 2 .   Click on the “Biograph” tab.  Both data elements are mandatory fields for NSC reporting. In addition, the Financial Aid Office is not  able   to   award student aid until valid data resides in these fields. You may need to contact the student  for this information. Recommend making this a required field on the online admission application.  Both   items  are  required Registration   Data Quality Reports  The Registration Office should run the following report   weekly   to ensure that all data is accurate and  up - to - date. Special attention should be placed on these reports prior to the beginning   of   campus - wide  advising sessions and prior to registration dates .   In addition, the report needs to be run and errors  corrected   before   running the NSC process.   The report is located here:  http://report.rcc.mass.edu/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fJenzabar+EX+Reports%2fReports%2fDash  boards%2fExecutive+Dashboard%2fRegistration%2fData+QC%2fNSC_All_Probs_By_Student_REG_Bucket&View  Mode=Detail  COMMON ERROR MESSAGE AND CORRECTIVE ACTION:  Incorrect Degree_History.Entry_DTE on Active degree History record. Correct Entry Date is  Shown in Additional Information.  Figure 3  In the   example above, the correct stu dent start   date can be located i n the actual report, in the circled  box . See Figure 3 above .   This date needs to be entered into the   Student Information Entry Date   box  below.   See Figure 4.  Figure 4 Advising   Data Quality Reports  The Advising Team Leader should run the following report   weekly   to ensure that all data is accurate  and up - to - date. Special attention should be placed on these reports prior to the beginning of   campus -  wide   advising sessions and prior to registration dates. In addition, the report needs to be run and  errors corrected immediately prior to running the NSC process. The report is located here:  http://report.rcc.mass.edu/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fJenzabar+EX+Reports%2fReport  s%2fDashboards%2fExecutive+Dashboard%2fRegistration%2fData+QC%2fNSC_All_Probs_By_Student_  ADV_Bucket&ViewMode=Detail  COMMON ERROR MESSAGE S   AND CORRECTIVE ACTION:  Missing or Incorrect AIMS  Often this problem can be cured by running the “Synchronize Advisee Information” tool in Jenzabar.  Use the Synchronize Advisee Information tool with the following options and many of these errors will  be corrected.   The “q_sync_advisee_info_any_wo_aims” query uses the same logic as the “Missing or  Incorrect AIMS” report.  Figure 5  After running the “Synchronize Advisee Information” tool, most of the errors noted in the report will  have been corrected.   See Figure 5.   For those still not corrected, examine the following possibilities.  Th ere   may be a a missing row in the “Degree/AIM Cross Reference” table, or an issue of data being  entered incorrectly in the Admission Module.   ALL   possible combinations of Majors, Degrees and Year  combinations must be entered in the Degree/AIM Cross Reference table in ord er for   an Advising  Worksheet to be created.   See F igure 5 .1 . Figure 5 .1   –   Degree/AIM Cross Reference table Verify the correct information is populated in the “Student Information” screen, “Degree” Tab. See the  highlighted fields in Figure 6. Verify   that   these are correct,   valid   combinations.   The data must be  corrected in this screen in order for the Advising Module to function correctly for this student.   In this  example, the major, ALABS is only offered as an AA degree. So the combination of ALABS / AS is  incorrect and will not produce any AIMS for the student.  Figure 6   –   Student Information Screen Enter the Admissions “Maintain Candidacy,” screen , “ Candidacy Tab,” and verify the correct Program  and Degree combinations have been entered. See Figure 7.   Whatever data is entered in these fields  will automatically be moved to the Registration and Advising Modules via the “Admission to  Registration” transfer process. As of version 6.5, there is no way to enforce that correct combinations  are entered or incorrect combinations are flagged.  Figure 7   –   Maintain Candidacy Screen Community and   Continuing Education   Data Quality Reports  The   Community and   Continuing   Education   Team Leader should run these reports   weekly   to ensure  that all data is accurate and up - to - date. Special attention should be placed on these reports prior to  running the NSC process. The report is located here:  http://report.rcc.mass.edu/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fJenzabar+EX+Reports%2fReport  s%2fDashboards%2fExecutive+Dashboard%2fRegistration%2fData+QC%2fNSC_All_Probs_By_Student_  CCE_Bucket&ViewMode=Detail  COMMON ERROR MESSAGE AND   CORRECTIVE ACTION:  Student Current Division is UG but only enrolled in NC courses. Requires review.  Figure 8  Access the “Student Information” screen in the RE Module. Access the “Student” tab. Change the  Current Division in the upper - left - hand corner of the screen to “NC.” Click the “Save” button in the  header. The newly saved data will automatically flow from the Student tab, to the Student Division  tab, to the Degree History tab.   See Figure 8.  1.   Change  Current  Division to  NC  2.   Start with the \"Student\" Tab, then move  to Student Division and then Degree.  Work from left to r ight   on these three tabs OTHER   COMMON ERROR MESSAGES AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS:  Missing Non - Degree Seeking checkbox on Active Degree History record.  [Degree_Hisotory].[Non_Degree_Seeking] is marked as No.  OR  Non - Degree Seeking checkbox is Checked for Degree - Seeking Major.  [Degree_History].[Non_Degree_Seeking] is checked as Yes.  Figure 9  Access the “Student Information” screen in the RE Module. Click on the “Degree” tab.   The “Non -  Degree Seeking” checkbox MUST BE CHECKED for students in non - credit   and non - diploma programs  (Continuing Education Division programs and classes).  The checkbox must NOT BE CHECKED for   credit   seeking students. A checkbox will stop the record  from being transmitted to NSC.   See Figure 9. Registrar   Data Quality Reports  This report lists   all   NSC data quality issues for all functional areas. It is the oversight report for use by  the Registrar's office.   The   Registrar should   run these reports   weekly   to ensure that all data is accurate  and up - to - date.   It is an aggregate or roll - up of all NSC reports placed into a single view and ordered by  student ID number. The report is located here:  http://report.rcc.mass.edu/Reports/Pages/Report.aspx?ItemPath=%2fJenzabar+EX+Reports%2fReport  s%2fDashboards%2fExecutive+Dashboard%2fRegistration%2fData+QC%2fNSC_All_Problems_By_Stude  nt  These reports must   also   be run immediately prior to submission of NSC data   and all errors corrected .  They may be run   anytime   prior to the   NSC   submission to address data issues that intermittently arise,  however they must be run and all data corrected immediately prior to NSC submission   in order to  prevent   NSC errors . The beginning of each term will potentially have the most issues to address and it  may   take several days to correct the   data based on the busy nature at   the beginning of each semester.  Some errors may require contacting the student for additional information.   Plan   accordingly   for this. COMMON ERROR MESSAGES AND HOW TO CORRECT THEM  ERROR MESSAGE   AND CORRECTIVE ACTION :  More than One Active Degree History record. Count of [Degree_History].[Active] is greater than 1.  Figure 10  Access the “Student Information” screen in the RE Module. Click on the “Degree” tab.   The “Active”  box should only be selected for Degree 1. Uncheck “Active” for all other degrees. If there is a second  major/program of study, enter it into Major 2 of Degree 1.   See Figure 10.  Only one  “Active”  degree is  allowed on a  Degree  History  Record  Major 2 ERROR MESSAGE   AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS :  Expected Graduation date is more than 30 days in the past. Expected Grad Year and Term must be  corrected.  Figure 11  Access the “Student Information” screen in the RE Module. Click on the “Degree” tab.   Update the  year and term to a future date as needed. It is permissible to add up to one year beyond the normal  graduation date for a student to accommodate possible repeated courses.   Simply indicating the  appropriate year and term will automatically populate the final day of the semester in the NSC  Anticipated Graduation Date tables.   Click “ Save. ”   See Figure 11.   (Process continues below). When the   following   dialogue box appears, verify the NSC Anticipated Grad date is in the future. Click  “OK” and the data will be copied to the Student Division tab.   See Figure 12.  Figure 12 PROCESS OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNANCE  O versight of the data integrity process is of the utmost importance.   For example, e rrors created early  in the Admission process will cascade to multiple Jenzabar modules and impact not only Admissions,  but Registration and Advising, as well.   Incorrect data   may also potentially impact Financial Aid and  the Business Office, depending on the type of error.   Therefore, it is critical that data errors be  corrected as part of a daily or weekly process   outlined earlier in this document .   CampusWorks  therefore recommends the following oversight :  1.   The Admission Director shall be responsible for the integrity of all Admission data. The   Admission  Director will work in conjunction with other   functional   offices to ensure the data is correct and  ready for NSC submission.  2.   The Director of Corporate College &   Community Education shall be responsible for the integrity of  the   data related to all non - credit courses and programs.  3.   The Academic Coordinator shall be responsible for the integrity of the Advising data. Since some  of these errors may have originated during other processes, the Academic Coordinator shall work  in conjunction with the other functional   areas to ensure the   consistenc y   and integrity of the data.  4.   The Registrar shall be responsible for the integrity of all Registration Data. Since the successful  submission of NSC data depends on all functional a reas, the Registrar shall take the   lead role in  ensuring all data integrity standards are being met   in other areas as well .   The Registrar shall send  a 90 minute Outlook Meeting Request to the data integrity team leaders of all functional areas as  soon as the NSC submission schedule is established (preferably late spring or early summer) for  the entire upcoming school year. The purpose of the series of meeting requests is not to establish  a meeting time, but to block off time for other team leaders to review and correct data issues  prior to running the NSC process . This meeting request should be 3 - 4 days in advance of each NSC  submission date. The Registrar shall run the aggregate report   and address any remaining data  quality issues the day prior to the NSC data submission.  The data correction duties may be delegated to other staff, however the ultimate responsibility   of  data   quality and   integrity   lies with   each team leader . NSC FILE SUBMISSION SCHEDULE  The NSC Submission Schedule must be determined by reviewing RCC semester dates and creating a schedule  for the entire upcoming school year. This schedule will be created on the secure section of the NSC website  ( http://studentclearinghouse.org/ ).   NSC recommends reporting enrollment data on a monthly basis. The  schedule for Fall and Spring Terms shall be designed as follows:  •   First of Term Submission: This is the initial report that will be submitted after the Add/Drop  Period (after all add/drops have been processed). This must be submitted   no later than 30  days after the beginning of the   semester   to   remain in compliance. However, it is best practice  to submit as soon as possible after the beginning of the term.  •   Subsequent of Term Submissions: These are to be submitted 30 - 45 days after the First of  Term Submission (i.e,. October, November, February, March and April).  •   Subsequent of Term for End of Term: This file may be submitted anytime between 5 days  before the end of the term, but no more than 30 days after the end of the term. [The purpose  of the final submission is to report late registering students and students who have withdrawn  or changed status].  The following refers to the Summer Semester ONLY. NSC recommends reporting every 30 days. Don’t worry  about subterms, simply report for the entire summer semester.  •   First of Term Submission: Same as Fall and Spring, as soon as all add/drops have been  processed.  •   Subsequent of Term Submissions: NSC recommends submitting every 30 days.  •   Subsequent of Term for End of Term: Same process as Fall and Spring  Graduates Only Submission : The purpose of this file is to report graduates who are not reported in the  Subsequent of Term for End of Term submission.   This must be scheduled after the term has ended, but  BEFORE the next First of Term Submission to NSC.   This must be submitted for any semester in which you have  students graduating.   Graduates must be reported within 30 days of their graduation date. 2017 - 18 NSC FILE SUBMISSION SCHEDULE  Term   Transmission Type   Scheduled Date  Fall 2017   First of Term   9/25/2017  Fall 2017   Subsequent of Term   10/23/2017  Fall 2017   Subsequent of Term   11/20/2017  Fall 2017   Subsequent of Term   12/18/2017  Fall 2017   Graduates Only   1/8/2018  Spring 2018   First of Term   2/5/2018  Spring 2018   Subsequent of Term   3/5/2018  Spring 2018   Subsequent of Term   4/2/2018  Spring 2018   Subsequent of Term   5/7/2018  Spring 2018   Graduates Only   6/1/2018  Summer   2018   First of Term   6/8/2018  Summer 2018   Summer Subsequent   7/18/2018  Summer 2018   Summer Subsequent   8/8/2018  Summer 2018   Graduates Only   8/17/2018",
