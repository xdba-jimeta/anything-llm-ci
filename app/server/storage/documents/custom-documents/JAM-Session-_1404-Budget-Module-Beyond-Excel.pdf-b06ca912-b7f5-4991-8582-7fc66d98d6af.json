June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Presented by Jessica Peña  Indiana Tech, Fort Wayne, Indiana  June 1, 2016  Budget Module: Beyond Excel © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  About Indiana Tech     Main campus in Fort Wayne, Indiana with 1,400 traditional day students on campus     Recently opened Law School addition on main campus     14 Satellite locations and online classes for our Continuing Professional Studies adult student population of about 8,000 students (online is about 60%). © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Finance creates an Excel workbook for each Budget Officer & emails out     Officers fill out Excel sheet, email to supervisors for review/approval, email to Finance     Finance meets with Deans/VPs to review     Finance combines Excel files into a single sheet, verifying formulas, and creating a summary “rolled up” report for the Board     Board approves budget     Finance puts Excel summary into a format for IT to upload into Jenzabar, IT uploads, and Finance does testing to ensure accuracy from requests to final upload.     Last step is to export finalized data and email approved worksheets to eachBudget Officer.  Previous Budget Process © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Zero Based Budget  •   Budget worksheets all start with zeros, not assuming the same as last year.     Managers Projection of where they will end the current year, in addition to the requests for next year  •   We create reports based on these projections for presentation to the Board  •   Used to be an additional column in the Excel reports  •   No additional fields allow this in the Budget Module, so we are running two separate budget years  Some Things Indiana Tech Does Differently © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Finance creates a worksheet for each Budget Officer only at the beginning of implementation, not annually; Officers are notified all at once instead of individual emails.     Officers fill out worksheet through the JICS portal, submit online to supervisors for review/approval. Same data, different format.  •   Officers now also have the option to specify the months to allocate dollars     Finance can see the worksheet status of each department at any time to confirm whether it is in progress or has been approved, and who it was approved by.     Finance meets with Deans/VPs to review  NEW Budget Process © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Reports are available as soon as the worksheets are marked Approved, so the step of combining Excel sheets was eliminated. (Saves finance staff lots of time)     Board approves budget     Since the JICS portal ties directly to Jenzabar, compiling and formatting for an IT upload is no longer necessary.  (Saves finance staff more time!)     A single approval email to all Officers is all that is needed; the approved budget is available throughout the year on the JICS Portal. No need to wait until after audit to make this visible to Officers.  NEW Budget Process © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Time savings throughout the whole budget cycle  •   No longer need weeks to do reporting and roll-ups  •   Able to pass the extra time to Budget Officers to prepare their data     Simpler Worksheets for Budget Officers     Stronger data integrity than Excel process     Ease of custom report formats “Budget Profiles”  •   Can use this to view budget proposals in various ways, such as all Office Supplies accounts, all Athletics by sport, projected Income Statement  •   Option of splitting report onto its own Excel tab when exporting – for example, each expense category on its own tab.  Why Implement the Jenzabar Budget Module? © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Replaces several previous processes  •   “Tech on Tap”: Internal reporting tool that was built outside of Jenzabar and required manual updating to keep current (now phasing out, as employees prefer JICS)  •   Finance email to each Budget Officer of a final Board-Approved budget for their departments  •   Gives Officers constant access to a lot of information that many didn’t have before. This cuts down on requests to Finance staff during the entire year.     Web-based reporting is available off-campus, so when coaches are doing budgets on the road, they still have easy access to all their information.     Security based on budget worksheet setup  •   Can set up employees with read-only access to their budget  •   We put Salary and Non Salary budget lines onto separate worksheets to enable additional staff to be able to see this information throughout the year  JICS Portal: Improved Budget vs Actual Reporting © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.
