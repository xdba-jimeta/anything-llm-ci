This method is used initially to populate JICS with your user and course information and is used on a regular basis to keep JICS updated with changes made within your ERP application.  W HAT IS THE   DIS ?  The DIS processes the following user and e-Racer data:  Information Types   Data Types  User Information   PRS  Roles   CST  Departments   DPT  Terms   TRM  Course Codes   CCD  Course Selections   CRS  Course Schedules   SCH  Course Membership   CRP  When a data import occurs, a batch file is created on the JICS server in the following location:  %:\\Program Files\\Jenzabar\\ICS.NET\\DIS\\Parsed  The .dat file is URL encoded and can be accessed from the Data Import Transaction portlet.  You can use mapping tables in your ERP to see the relationships.  In order to understand the data dependencies between the various data types mentioned above, view the illustration below.  According to this illustration, you will see four different levels of dependency in the data transactions.  The top of the hierarchy are the TRM, DPT, and PRS records – no other transaction types on any other level can proceed unless one of these transactions has occurred. Therefore, you will notice that DPT has two directly dependent transactions (CCD and CST) as well as three indirectly dependent transactions (CRS, SCH, and CRP).  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  5   5  F AILED   B ATCHES  The DIS will stop processing new batches if the last batch failed during processing. In order to troubleshoot the failed DIS, you will first need to determine the data that needs to be added, updated, or deleted in JICS. The EX application uses the following tables for this purpose:     TW_API_PRS      TW_API_CST     TW_API_DPT      TW_API_TRM     TW_API_CCD      TW_API_CRS     TW_API_SCH      TW_API_CRP  Notice that these tables have the same name as the data types.  Let's examine a couple of sample log files for failed batches and review the solution for each.  Example #1  This batch failed because the course could not be found as indicated directly within the log file:  PRS,U,*,1,1,********,Jessica,Jean,Steadman,*,jsteadman%40hotmail%2E com,N  CRS,A,0,Course not found (Course Code: IDCH 599,2006-01-30 12:08:56, 2005 20, IDCH 599, L1F  000,Chunk Complete – 1 successful 1 errors  Solution to Example #1  1   Stop the Jenzabar EX Web service  2   Run a query to delete the row identified in the log file  Delete from tw_api_ccd  Where crs_cde like 'IDCH%599%'  3   Change the batch number to the last successful batch in UI Config  4   Repost failed batch in API Batch Control  5   Start Jenzabar EX Web service  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  6  Example #2  This batch failed because the section could not be found as indicated directly within the log file  PRS,U,*,1,1,********,Jessica,jean,Steadman,*jsteadman%40hotmail%2Ec om,N  CRP,A,0,Section not found,2006-01-30 15:08:56,2005 20 IDCH 599, L1F,372982  000,Chunk Complete – 1 successful 1 errors  Solution to Example #2  1   Stop the Jenzabar EX Web service  2   Delete the one row for the course section in tw_api_crs  3   Change batch number to the last successful batch in UI Config  4   Repost failed batch in API Batch Control  5   Start Jenzabar EX Web service  Rep airing Failed Batches in EX  You can use the   Data Import Transactions   window to view batch information. When you encounter a failed batch, use the following steps to repair the batch:  1   Stop the Jenzabar EX Web service on the Web server  2   In the   Data Import Transactions   window, review the errors in the log file to determine the data that needs to be changed or re-submitted to JICS  3   In the Web Administration module, go to the   API Batch Control   window  4   Select the most recent batch and click   Repost Batch   – the row will then disappear from the list  5   In the Web Administration module, go to the   UI Configuration   window  6   Choose the category   Jenzabar   from the drop down menu and locate the row for batch_number (that is, the number of the last successful batch)  7   Click   Save  8   Start the Jenzabar EX Web service on the Web server  The entire failed batch, including any data that has been changed since the failed batch, will re-send after 60 seconds.  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  7   7  T ROUBLESHOOTING  What should I do if a batch will not post?  Possible Solutions:     Does your ERP have new data to send.     Is your Jenzabar EX Web service is running – re-starting the service may trigger the batch to be sent.     Is the DIS service running?     Is the te_pgmr password correct in the Web Administration module Profile Manager?     Is your version of Web Support compatible with your version of EX?     Is a batch already processing or suspended?  What should I do if a batch has been processing for an exceptional amount of time and appears to be suspended?  Possible Solutions:     Do you have a .DAT file in the Program Files\\Jenzabar\\ICS.NET\\DIS\\Current folder?  o   There should be no more than one file in the folder     If you do have a .DAT file in the Current folder, then check the most recent .LOG file in Program Files\\Jenzabar\\ICS.NET\\DIS\\Logs and see if the file size continues to increase. If so, then the DIS is not actually suspended and you should continue to let the processing occur.     If the .LOG is stuck at the same file size, stop the DIS service and start it again. Check the .LOG file to see if it continues to grow in size and, if not, stop the DIS service again.     Move the .DAT file from the Current directory to Queued.     Start the DIS service – the .DAT file should automatically move to Current when the file is processed and then move into the Parsed directory when processing has completed.  W HERE DOES   JICS   OBTAIN DATA ?  There are a few components that operate together in order to identify the various types of data that is displayed within JICS.  AD - LDS     Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD-LDM) is an LDAP Directory Service and is a lightweight version of Active Directory.     AD-LDS stores information about the structure of your site (Context, Page, and Portlet placement) as well as being used for authentication and authorization in JICS.     All users and their respective login information are stored in AD-LDS.     AD-LDS stores information related to Group Membership (Global Base Roles and Context- Level Roles).     AD-LDS stores information related to the access that is granted to each group (Context, Page, Portlet, Operations).  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  8  JICS Database     JICS uses a Microsoft SQL Server database (typically ICS_NET) for storing application data.     User information is also stored in the database (FWK_User table) to associate users with their respective data.     JICS tables in the database are prefixed to identify the category to which they belong – for example FWK = Framework, COM = Common, LMS = Learning Management System.  e - Racer and the JICS Database     Learning Management System (LMS) relies heavily on the JICS database to store and use application data such as:  o   Coursework (LMS_Coursework and related tables)  o   Attendance (LMS_Attendance)  o   Grade books (LMS_Gradebook)  o   Schedules (LMS_Schedule)     The DIS is responsible for setting up each Course Section that is sent from the ERP in AD-LDS and the database.     The DIS creates all the necessary entries in the LMS tables for the Course Section to be ready to use.     All data input from the students and faculty in LMS is stored in the LMS tables by JICS.     If a user is dropped from a course section in the ERP but the DIS has already been sent that information which updated JICS, that user is still present in the course section until the DIS updates JICS.  o   In other words, LMS does not reflect real time data against the ERP but it does reflect real time data against the JICS database tables and AD-LDS.  By default, EX will check the DIS every 15 minutes.  Portlet Data and the JICS Database     Portlet data is stored in a corresponding JICS database table.  o   For example, when a bookmark is added to an instance of the Bookmarks portlet, a row is added to ICS_Bookmark with all the information needed for that item. Every time that particular Bookmarks portlet instance is loaded, the ICS_Bookmark table is accessed to find the data needed to be displayed.  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  9   9  CRMs and the Plugins  Portlets that belong to a Constituent Relationship Module (CRM) receive data from the ERP via the Plugins.     Plugins exist for each Jenzabar ERP which allows JICS to communicate back and forth with that ERP.  o   Each set of Plugins knows how to communicate with a particular ERP.     When a CRM portlet displays information from the ERP, that information is real-time.     The DIS is not involved in the ability of the CRM to view new or changed data.  o   The only time the DIS is involved in CRM portlets is when role data is uploaded to JICS and the permissions for the CRM portlet are role driven.     The business logic and SQL used to query the ERP tables are contained in the Plugins for that particular ERP.  P ERFORMING   A DMINISTRATIVE   F UNCTIONS  The diagram below provides a visual representation of the relationship that exists between JICS (your Web server), the EX application (your client workstation), and the database server components.  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  10  U   NDERSTANDING THE   AD-LDS   F   OLDER   S   TRUCTURE  Access AD-LDS ADSI Edit from your Web Server (AD-LDS ADSI Edit):  Basically, CN indicates Context and OU indicates Organizational Unit.  Within the directory structure   of O=Jenzabar , C=US , you will see several sub-folders beginning with CN. In the illustration above,   CN=Portal   is the highest context level in JICS.  As you expand the   CN=Portal folder , keep the following in mind: Each CN folder beneath   CN=Portal   is a sub-context that refers to the tabs displayed across the top of the JICS portal     OU=PortalTemplates   will display a list of all portlets that have been installed – remember, you will still need to add these portlets to pages but this list indicates that the portlets are available for the page     OU=PortalUsers   will display a list of logins – by clicking on a login you will be able to view its attributes (such as member of a group, email address, and the UID which is the ID number from the ERP)  In the example below, the   CN=Academics   sub-context is expanded and you will see the progression of sub-contexts that exist within it.  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  11   11     OU=Groups   will display a list of groups that have been defined – by clicking on a group, you will be able to view a list of individuals belonging to the group (member attribute)     OU=Operations   will display a list of operations for the portlet – by clicking on the name of an operation, you will be able to see the details for the operation     OU=Pages   will display a list of pages defined for the context – by expanding a page, you will be able to see the portlets that are displayed on the page  E NABLING   P ASSWORD   P OLICIES  You can lock out users after a certain number of login in attempts; however, you must first enable the password policy in AD-LDS.  1   Open   ADSI Edit   in Administrative Tools in the Start menu  2   Go to ADSI EDIT, My Connection (localhost:389) CN=Configuration, CN=Services, CN=Windows NT, CN=Directory Service  3   Right click on   CN=Directory Service   and click   Properties  4   Double-click on the   msDS-Other Settings   line  5   Select the line   ADAMDisablePasswordPolicies=1  6   Click   Remove  7   Change the right-most character from 1 to 0 in the   Value to Add   area  8   Click   Add  o   Verify the list of values now includes the line   ADAMDisablePasswordPolicies=0  9   Click   OK   twice – your password policies are now enabled  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  12  Unlocking a User  1   Open   ADSI Edit  2   Right click on the connection and select the   New Query   option  3   Enter the name   Find a user   and click the   Browse...   button  4   Browse to   Portal Users   (single click) and click   OK  o   O=Jenzabar,C=US   will now appear in the root search field  5   In the string query enter   CN=33  where 33 is the login of the user you wish to unlock  6   Click   OK  7   On the left pane, click your   Find a user   query  8   On the right you should see your user – right-click on the user and select   Properties  9   Find the   lockoutTime   attribute, select it, click   Edit ,   Clear  10   Click   OK   twice  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  13   13  Resetting a Password  Another way to unlock the user is to reset the user's password.  1   Open   ADSI Edit  2   Go to ADSI Edit, My Connection (localhost:389) CN=Portal, OU=Portal Users  3   Locate the user  4   Right-click and select   Reset Password  5   Enter the new password, confirm the password, and click   OK  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  14  C   ONFIGURING THE   S   ECURE   S   OCKETS   L   AYER  If you are using SSL, reinstall the Secure Sockets Layer Technology certificate and open Internet Information Services Manager.  1   Go to   Web Sites → Default Web Site   directory tree  2   Right-click and select   Properties  3   Click the   Directory Security   tab  4   If the View Certificate is disabled, click the   Server Certificate   button and select the certificate  5   Enter the SSL port on the   Web Site   tab (port 443 should always be used)  Exception:  EX clients cannot require SSL on the site. The Jenzabar EX Web service on the local Web server must be able to perform a one-way post of data to itself ( http://localhost/ics/post.dis ). We do not have the ability to post to https at this time.  6   Insert the following code at the beginning of the following file: D:\\Program Files\\Jenzabar\\ICS.NET\\Portal\\default.aspx  <%  if(!Request.IsSecureConnection)  Response.Redirect(String.Concat(\"https://\",  Request.ServerVariables[\"SERVER_NAME\"],  Request.RawUrl));  %>  When selecting http://<jics.site>/..., this code should perform a redirect to https://<jics_site>/...  7   Go to   IIS → Default Web → ICS → Properties → Directory Security → Secure Communications → Edit  8   Uncheck the   Require SSL   checkbox  o   This should not affect security of data out on the Internet  9   In   EX Web Admin → Configuration → UI Config → Jenzabar , post URL should start with http and not https  o   This should already be configured  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  15   15  D EFAULT   T EMPLATES  When JICS is installed, the   Templates   folder in the ICS.NET/Portal/ClientConfig directory is created. You will find a Course template that is used for every course transferred over from your ERP via the DIS.  The   Personal Context   template defines the information that each person will be granted, by default, on  My Pages . If you would like to display Campus Groups on My Pages, you can change the   Personal Context   template. However, keep in mind that the change will only impact new users and the modified template will not affect existing users. You will find four xml files in the   Templates   folder:     Default Course     Default Course Section     Default Department     Default Personal Context  Editing the Default Templates  While you can certainly use the default templates as they are delivered with the JICS installation, you may find that certain modifications helpful to fit your specific needs.  In this case, we would encourage you to do so by using a resource comfortable in reading and editing XML. Since every school has different requirements, you will need to determine the section of xml that must be edited for your specific needs and to provide you with the desired results.  Sample xml:  <Context Name=\"Test\" DisplayName=\"My Test Context\" IsSystemObject=\"True\" Type=\"CourseSection\" ShowChildNodesInSidebar=\"True\" Order=\"1\" DefaultPage=\"Main Page\" Grant=\"Faculty\"/>  The table below provides a list of the attributes and their respective descriptions that were used in the sample xml file above. You can use this information to determine the section of xml that needs to be edited.  Attribute   Description  ContextName   The name of the context (for the course section template, this is overridden by LMS)  DisplayName   The display name of the context (for the course section templates, this is overridden by LMS)  IsSystemObject   This controls various factors such as whether or not a user can delete the context  Hidden   TODO: check where this is hidden  Type   The type of context (available options are CourseSection, TODO: Fill in)  ShowChildNodesInSidebar   Show subsections in the sidebar (true or false)  Order  DefaultPage   The name of the default page  Grant   Grants administrative privileges to the specified context role (separate multiple entries with a ;)  GrantGlobal   Grants administrative privileges to the specified base role  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  16  SQL   S   ERVER   D   ATABASE   S   CRIPTS  You can use two scripts to assist you when initially populating the tw tables in EX for configuring and maintaining the EX Web module. These scripts are available for download on MyJenzabar.net ( Support  → EX → Application Downloads → EX Web Downloads ).     Click on the Utility SQL Scripts for Web Admin link.     Use the Extract option so that the files are placed in the correct sequence on your computer – that is, you will want to create your Web users first before you create a job.     Scripts contain WHERE clauses that may need to be modified for your specific school since they were created using sample data.  Be sure to read the notes and instructions – this process is recommended to be performed only by a skilled database administrator.  P HOTO   U PLOAD  Always create a backup of the ICS_NET database and specifically the ICSA_UploadFile database table prior to starting this process.  1   Create a sub-directory on the Web server under the ISFileServer directory called UserPhotos  2   Copy all photos to the UserPhotos directory  3   Using Query Manager, run the first part of the script below to create the ID_Pict_Mapping table in the ICS_Net database  4   Update the ID_Pict_Mapping table so that each user has one entry (ID number and name of picture file ID)  o   The name of the picture file can be the same as the ID or it can be different  5   Run the Insert Into* portion of the script to take the ID_Pict_Mapping table and insert records into the ICS_Uploadfile for each ID with missing records  6   If the name of the picture file changes, update it in the ID_Pict_Mapping table then run the last part of the script starting with Update ICS_UploadFle*  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  17   17  Script  CREATE TABLE ID_Pict_Mapping  (   ID_NUMBER   int   NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,  PICTURE_FILE_NAME   varchar(255)   NOT NULL)  Go  This insert will add ICS_UploadFile rows where there is none for the user in ID_Pict_Mapping with the specified PICTURE_FILE_NAME  INSERT INTO ICS_UploadFile (ID, ParentID, Name, Path, Type, ItemSize)  SELECT NEWID(), FWK_User.ID, rtrim(ID_Pict_mapping.Picture_File_Name),  '/ICSFileServer/UserPhotos/' + rtrim(ID_Pict_mapping.Picture_File_Name), '.jpg', '2k'  FROM FWK_User  JOIN ID_Pict_Mapping  ON FWK_User.HostID = ID_Pict_Mapping.ID_NUMBER  LEFT OUTER JOIN ICS_UploadFile  ON FWK_User.ID = ICS_UploadFile.ParentID AND  ICS_UploadFile.Path = '/ICSFileServer/UserPhotos/' + rtrim(ID_Pict_mapping.Picture_File_Name) AND  ICS_UploadFile.Name = rtrim(ID_Pict_mapping.Picture_File_Name)  WHERE FWK_User.HostID IS NOT NULL  AND ICS_UploadFile.ID IS NULL  Go  This will update existing rows in ICS_UploadFile in the event that the file name changed.

In most cases, the encryption in your ERP will be disabled by default; however, we suggest that you verify.  In the CX application:     Modify the ENABLE_JICS_PASSWORD_ENC macro from Y to N in the $CARSPATH/macros/custom/common directory     Reinstall the macro file     Reinstall $CARSPATH/modules/common/scripts/jenzupload     Using isql or dbaccess, issue the SQL command UPDATE jenzprs_rec SET first_name='CHANGED'  In the EX application:     Go to the   UI Configuration   window     Select   Jenzabar   from the   Category Name   field drop down menu     Set the api_encrypt_passwords value to N  U SER   L OGIN   S TATISTICS  SST_SessionInfo contains a row for every time a user logs in (up to the point that the Process Stats job last ran). Run this query for a list of who has logged in and how many times:  select count(*), si.UserID, u.firstname, u.lastname  from ics_net_stat..sst_sessioninfo si,  ics_net..fwk_user u  where si.userid = u.id  group by si.UserID, u.firstname, u.lastname  order by count(*) desc  E XTERNAL   A UTHENTICATION  The advantages for utilizing an external system to authenticate your users are:     To identify a single source for controlling user access to more than one system     Users need to only remember one user name and password  If you do not use external authentication, the illustration below will demonstrate how JICS user information is maintained:  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  19   19  Consider the following:     Users must exist first in the ERP system     User name must be identical in both the ERP system and AD-LDS     When user names and passwords are imported into JICS, they are stored in AD-LDS     The system will use AD-LDS to authenticate the user's information  On the other hand, external authentication utilizes a slightly different process:  Consider the following:     User names ONLY (not passwords) are imported into JICS by the Data Import Service     The user name and password are verified by the external server     AD-LDS is used to determine the privileges that are granted to the user  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  20  Setting up External Authentication  When setting up external authentication using LDAP, you will need to review the information that exists in the Web.config file within the <authentication> element. This file can be found in the following location:  Program Files\\/Jenzabar/ICS.NET/Portal/  1   Before external authentication is activated, log in to JICS, click on   Site Manager , click on   Site Settings   tab, click   Edit   from   Framework Settings  2   Choose   Security   from the category  drop-down menu  3   Enter the name of the context in the  LoginContext   field that should be used  4   Modify the   FWK_ConfigSettings   table and where the   Key   is   LoginContext , enter the same context that was entered in the security settings  5   Then update the   FWK_ConfigSettings  table so that   UseExternalAuthentication  is set to   True  The last step is to specify the roles in your ERP that will be validated using external authentication     For EX, go to the Web Administration module and access the Role Definition screen     For CX, access the role_table  JICS System Administration Quick Guide J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  21   21  B ACKUP   P ROCEDURES  Configure for backups (required first time only)  Create a 'JICS Backups' folder on each of the servers (JICS and SQL Server)  Full Backup  During most of this procedure, AD-LDS will be stopped to prevent users from accessing and possibly modifying the JICS data. This will ensure that the AD-LDS data and the SQL Server database are in synch when the backups occur.
