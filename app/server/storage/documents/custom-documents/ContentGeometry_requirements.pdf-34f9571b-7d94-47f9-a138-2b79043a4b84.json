The system ensures data integrity, transparency,  secure access management, and usage tracking using blockchain technology.  2. Project Scope The project includes developing smart contracts for content submission and usage tracking, interfacing  with a user - centric frontend, managing submissions, controlling access, and ensuring effective  deployment and maintenance.  3. Smart Contract Development  3.1 Content Submission Contract  •   Language : Solidity.  •   Functionality :  o   Manage submission and storage of content hashes and metadata.  o   Handle permissions for content submission and retrieval.  3.2 Content Hash Storage  •   Objective : Store cryptographic hashes of the content on the blockchain.  •   Details :  o   Generate and store hashes upon content submission alongside metadata.  3.3 Metadata and Ownership  •   Data Storage : Content title, description, submission timestamp, and owner's Ethereum address.  •   Ownership Tracking : Use the Ethereum address of the submitter recorded during transactions.  3.4 Content Usage Tracking Contract  •   Purpose : Track and log the usage of content chunks in responses.  •   Functionality :  o   Log each instance a chunk is used, including the user or process utilizing it.  o   Store identifiers or references to the specific chunks and usage context (e.g., time, type  of usage).  4. Blockchain Interfacing  4.1 User Interface  •   Development : Build a web or mobile application for user interactions.  •   Features : Allow users to submit content, track how their content is used, and interact with the  system.  4.2 Wallet Integration  •   Integration : Include MetaMask or other blockchain wallets.  •   Purpose : Facilitate user transactions and manage gas fees. 5. Handling Submissions  5.1 Submission Function  •   Smart Contract Function : Develop to accept and record new submissions.  •   Inputs : Content hash and metadata.  5.2 Validation  •   Optional : Check for duplicate content by comparing hashes.  6. Access and Visibility  6.1 Public vs. Private Access  •   Access Control : Define and implement public or restricted access protocols.  6.2 Event Logging  •   Logging : Use blockchain events to log submissions, updates, accesses, and content usage.  7. Testing and Deployment  7.1 Testing  •   Environment : Test on Ethereum testnets.  •   Goals : Verify functionality, security, and performance.  7.2 Deployment  •   Network : Deploy to Ethereum mainnet.  •   Documentation : Provide instructions for user interaction with the dApp.  8. Maintenance and Updates  8.1 Upgradeability  •   Approach : Employ proxy contracts for future upgrades.  8.2 Monitoring  •   Implementation : Use tools to monitor smart contract activity.  •   Maintenance Strategy : Regular updates and security checks.  9. Considerations  •   Scalability : Address scalability and performance issues.  •   Costs and Environmental Impact : Analyze and mitigate costs and environmental aspects of  blockchain use.",
