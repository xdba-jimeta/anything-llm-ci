Ideally, the logic for the placement would be re - written to avoid the infinite DELETEs and INSERTS.  However the SQL code is exceedingly complex and would require substantial investment to rewrite.  Ther efore, it is   less expensive to RCC to maintain the off - the - shelf triggers instead.  Two triggers must be modified:   TR_DEL_STUDENT_CRS_HIST   and   TI_STUDENT_CRS_HIST  1.   Locate the trigger source code   for   TI_STUDENT_CRS_HIST . The triggers are on the  Student_Co urse_Hist table.  2.   Open the trigger source code from SQL Server Management Studio using the “Script Trigger As |  ALTER To | New Query Window” menu item. See Figure 1 Figure 1  3.   Locate the portion of the code   where the   Student_Master.run_academic_recalc field is being set to  the value 1. See Figure 2.  Figure 2  4.   The highlighted code is the code that needs to be added.

DDM   provides a certain  measure of data security that is lacking when an organization decides to allow back - door acce ss to the  enterprise database. Due to   RCC ’ s widesp read use of Mic roso ft Access   with   Linked Ta bles , and the  gaping security hole th at is opene d up by this practice ,   RCC decided to implement the recommendation  provided by CampusWorks I nc. to apply   D DM to the Jenzabar and PowerFAIDS databases.  Per Jenzabar ’s feedback on this subject, DDM is effective in these situations.   Jen z abar   also point ed out  th at the DDM would need to be reapplied after every up grade. These work instructions cover   that  process .  Work Instructions  The database administrator, or one with sys admin role will need to run a script that applies the DDM to  the two databases. The script is named,   “ JEF_Apply_Dynamic_Data_Masking.sql ”   and is located in the  “ S: \\ RCC Work Instructions \\ IT ”   network folder.  1.
