A DVISING   O VERVIEW  This chapter will provide a basic overview of the purpose for using the Advising module and introduce you to functions related to the software.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand the basic purpose of the Advising module    O VERVIEW  The Advising module is very different from the other modules – its success depends entirely on the manner in which you identify your requirements of which there are several types:  Course Requirements  Do courses need to be taken in a specific sequence – such as prerequisites – or can one course be substituted for another?  Degree Requirements  What courses need to be taken for a specific major, minor, or certification program?  Student Requirements  What degree(s) is associated with a student?  Graduation Requirements  What progress has a student made towards their graduation and what needs have to be met in order for the student to complete their degree for graduation?  These four major components must be implemented correctly in order for the software to function as it should and, if any component is not complete or inaccurate, your results will be invalid. Since each of these steps build on the other, you must be sure that they are performed in the correct order.  Defining your institutional requirements is the heart of the Advising module and, if not properly identified, the program will not function as it should.  We will also use terminology that is specific to the Jenzabar Advising module, which will be explained in further detail below. EX Advising Learning Guide   8  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  F ACTS ABOUT   A DVISING     If you do not have Advising Requirement Codes (ARCs) on the Student Course History, you do not have an Advising module – this is one of the first places to turn if your Advising module is not providing you with the desired results.     You must have an ARC for every course in your catalog. You do not need to have a course in your catalog for every ARC.     All Institutional Requirements (IRQs) are, in fact, ARCs. Not all ARCs are IRQs.     All Roots are, in fact, Groups. Not all Groups are Roots.     There is no such thing in the Advising module as a grandparent or a grandchild – only parent-child relationships exist.     A student cannot have more than one *FREE bucket attached to them at a single time.     You cannot split any type of ARC at any time.     Once something is on the Student Course History, no changes will impact the information that has been saved from previous courses. Therefore, academic history is not changed by anything.     After adding an alteration, you must perform a recalc in order for the alteration to be applied.  Each of these facts will be addressed and supported within the remainder of this document. You will recognize these statements since the text will appear as follows:  You cannot split any type of ARC at any time. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  9  Chapter 4.   U NDERSTANDING THE   T ERMINOLOGY  This chapter will explain the terminology that is used within the Advising module.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand the ‘tree’ analogy     Use parent/child relationships and control mechanisms to further define your curriculum     Apply ARCs to every course in your catalog     Evaluate your institutional requirements     Use aims and aim labels to define your degree requirements  S UMMARY  A tree is a non-linear data structure that consists of a root and several branches setup in a hierarchical format. In discussing the Advising module, there will be several references made to ‘trees’. Let’s first examine the analogy between trees and the Advising module.  The tree has a root at the bottom, which holds everything together. The branches extend out from the root and leaves grow out from the branches.  By using this same concept in the Advising module, you will notice that the root represents a general requirement – for example, you may have a root of Biology Major. All of your curriculum must fit within your root system – but remember that each tree can only have one root.  The trunk and branches of the tree represents groups, which give the tree substance – such as General Biology, Biology Electives, Scientific Biology, etc.  The leaves represent the courses (ARCs) that belong to each group – that is, the General Biology group may include Biology for Beginners, Fundamentals of Biology, Genetics, Biology Seminar, etc.  All Roots are, in fact, Groups. Not all Groups are Roots.  In the process of creating our trees in Advising, we will need to turn our tree upside down. That is, visually, we will create our root, then our groups, and then attach our courses to them. EX Advising Learning Guide   10  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  For illustration purposes, we will create ‘bubble trees’ which will allow us to indicate which ARCs are the Root, Groups, and individual Courses as illustrated here:  Within the tree structure, we have the following criteria that further define your curriculum:     Parent/Child Relationships     Control Mechanisms     AND/OR     Grid     Grade  Parent/Child Relationships  In the Parent/Child relationship within the tree data structure, the parent node (root) is composed of children (values and references) that form a hierarchy.  There is no such thing in the Advising module as a grandparent or a grandchild – only parent-child relationships exist.  Let’s take a look at a sample tree.   This tree shows the following parent/child relationships:  Parent   Child  BIOMAJ   Course 1  Course 2  Course 3  Group 1  Group 1   Course 4  Course 5  Group 2  Group 2   Course 6  Course 7 EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  11  Control Mechanisms  Three different control mechanisms can be used to identify your curriculum rules. These are used in combination with your parent/child relationships.     AND/OR Relationships     Grid     Grade  AND/OR Relationships  The first and foremost control mechanism is the AND/OR relation. This configuration is used during the tree building process.  A group or parent with a relation of AND indicates that a student must successfully complete all of the associated groups or child courses to meet a requirement.  At least one of the child requirements having a parent with an OR relation must be successfully completed before the parent requirement can be satisfied.  Let’s add another column to the parent/child table that was discussed earlier and now include the AND/OR relation:  Parent   Relation   Child   What does this mean?  BIOMAJ   AND   Course 1   To satisfy the BIOMAJ requirement, a student must successfully complete Course 1 AND Course 2 AND Course 3 AND Group 1 AND   Course 2  AND   Course 3  AND   Group 1  Group 1   OR   Course 4   To satisfy the Group 1 requirement, a student must successfully complete Course 4 OR Course 5 OR Group 2 OR   Course 5  OR   Group 2  Group 2   AND   Course 6   To satisfy the Group 2 requirement, a student must successfully complete Course 6 AND Course 7 AND   Course 7  Grid  So, what determines when a requirement is successfully completed? This is another set of control mechanisms that can be put in place in order to make that determination. You may want to use a Grid that identifies a minimum or maximum number of hours or count. For example:  Hours   Count  Min 124  Max 1  Using the BIOMAJ example, a student will need to successfully complete all three children PLUS at least 124 hours. EX Advising Learning Guide   12  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Grade  The third control mechanism is Grade that can be identified by minimum GPA or minimum grade. Using the same BIOMAJ example shown above, you can also include a minimum GPA of 3.0. So, in order to meet the BIOMAJ requirements, a student will need to complete a minimum of 124 hours as well as receive a minimum 3.0 GPA.  How is this done? Do you place a minimum GPA on each course? In actuality, you could do this; however, you cannot place a minimum grade on a group and expect every course in that group to require a grade of C or better. If you plan to use minimum grade, you must place it on every single ARC. Each course would need to have a minimum grade of B. Can this be done through Registration?  If every single Chemistry Major, Physical Education, English, and Psychology Major who takes this course needs to get a C or better, then you can do this through Registration. However, if this only pertains to one specific major, then do it on the Advising side.  What is an ARC?  An Advising Requirement Code (ARC) is an abbreviated description of a course that is used to identify its equivalency within meeting a defined set of requirements. This equivalency plays a very important role in three key areas:     The advising process     Prerequisites and corequisite checking     Repeat logic  If you do not have Advising Requirement Codes (ARCs) on the Student Course History, you do not have an Advising module – this is one of the first places to turn if your Advising module is not providing you with the desired results.  Every course that is offered in your course catalog must be identified with an ARC in the Advising system. ARCs reside on the Catalog Master, the Section Master, and the Student Course History.  You must have an ARC for every course in your catalog. You do not need to have a course in your catalog for every ARC.  Some benefits for using ARCs are as follows:     Courses can still be properly identified even if the course number changes     Cross-listed courses can be associated with the same requirement     Transfer courses can be associated with its equivalency EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  13  In order to obtain a clear understanding of your needs, we will examine a few specific situations where ARCs have a huge impact on the desired result.  Your institution has a course offering called   Accounting I for Beginners. Within the registration process, this same course is referred to as   ACCT-101 .  Now, you will want to identify this same course with an ARC in the Advising module for the purpose of knowing where this course fits into the student’s course needs.  A student takes a Beginning Accounting course at another institution and transfers into your institution. The Beginning Accounting course is accepted as the equivalency for the Accounting I for Beginners course but how will the Advising system recognize this? When a student takes a course at another institution and the course is accepted as transfer work, the ARC will be used to associate the transferred course to the equivalency at your institution by assigning an ARC.  Although every course must be identified with an ARC, not every ARC needs to be associated with a course – this is referred to as Wildcard ARCs.  Consider the fact that you may have a transfer student with courses that do not fit into any of your offerings. Therefore, you may way to create a Wildcard ARC called   FREE ELECTIVE . This AIM should be associated with a Cumulative type and you can place all of these transfer courses into the AIM called   FREE ELECTIVE.  The one disadvantage to using this strategy is that you will lose the one-to-one association and will not be able to identify the name of the transferred course at some point in the future.  Assign numbers 901 through 910 to each of your departments such as PSY, MATH, and ENG. DO NOT associate these ARCs with a Cumulative type. You will then be able to transfer in as many as 10 courses for each department. This structure can be built directly into your tree – nothing needs to be done in Registration, only in Advising.  Let’s take a look at a specific scenario as it relates to cross-listed courses.  You have three courses with three ARCs: SOC150 (SOC150), PSY150 (PSY150),  ECON150 (ECON150).  The same instructor teaches these courses in the same room. If each course has a different ARC, what will happen if a student takes   PSY150   in the fall, does not pass the course, and then takes   SOC150   in the spring? Consider the option of repeat logic. If ARCs are different, you will not be able to use repeat logic in this situation. Therefore, one solution would be to choose one ARC and apply it to all of the Section Masters in the string. Therefore, your courses would look like this:  SOC150 (SOC150)  PSY150 (SOC150)  ECON150 (SOC150)  Now when you are building your SOC, PSY, and ECON trees, you will look for the ARC of   SOC150 . Once the course has been taken, the actual course title will be displayed. EX Advising Learning Guide   14  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You may also have a situation where undergraduate students take a 300-level course and graduate students take the same class with a 500-level designation. Since you can only choose one ARC on the Section Master for the course, you can identify it as the 300-level course and then use the   Transfer Entry   option for graduate students.  Communications 410   is a course with   Section 1: Public Relations,   Section 2:  Radio & Theatre ,   Section 3: Advanced Public Speaking . Two sections can meet Major requirements for a semester. So you may want to set up a spreadsheet that shows the following:  COM410.01 = COM410A   (this is the ARC)  COM410.02 = COM410B  COM410.03 + COM410A   (if repeat logic is applied to the first section, it must have the same ARC)  You will need to track which courses are associated with an ARC and then enter those ARCs in your Section Master (for repeat logic).  What would you do for Independent Study? Create COM410.IS or COM410.I2, COM410.I3 for different instructors.  So, in general, an ARC is equivalent to a course.  Within the Advising module, everything is built on either the ARC table ( Maintain Advising Requirement Codes   window) or the TREE table ( Maintain Institutional Requirements   window). Roots, groups, courses, etc. reside on the ARC table – basically, PSY150 is just PSY150 on the ARC table. Now, when PSY150 becomes part of a tree, this ARC will now become a requirement for the PSYMAJ. Whereas the ARC table is global, the TREE table is local. Understanding this theory will help you determine where to implement changes to obtain the appropriate results.  PSY150 is changed from a 4-hour course to a 3-hour course on the ARC table. The change is applied everywhere this course exists – that is, every root, group, etc. This is a global change. If this same change to PSY150 is made on the TREE table, the change is applied locally – that is, PSY150 will appear as a 3-hour course only on the tree for the specific student and specific year in which the change was made. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  15  What is an IRQ?  The establishment of institutional requirements (IRQs) is the foundation of the Advising module. IRQs are used to measure the quantitative and qualitative achievements of a student. These measurements will, in turn, determine when a student has met their requirements and be eligible for graduation.  All Institutional Requirements (IRQs) are, in fact, ARCs. Not all ARCs are IRQs.  Core English institutional requirements may look something like this:  Requirement   Type   Cluster Code   Relation Type  ENGCORE   ROOT   R (Root)   AND  ENG111   CRS   C  ENG201   GROUP   G (Group)  ENG252   CRS   C  ENG351   CRS   C  ENGELT   GROUP   G (Group)  This very simple tree shows the courses that need to be taken in order to meet the ENGCORE requirement.  As you can see, the process of establishing your institutional requirements will ensure the success of the Advising module and will involve the proper allocation of time and effort by your administration personnel.  What is an Aim?  An Aim is associated with root level requirements that are attached to students. The name that is given to an Aim is called an Aim Label – such as MAJOR, MINOR, GENED, etc. Four different Aim Types exist to categorize aim labels as being Active, Inactive, Prospective, and Other.  When you define a Major aim label and assign it to a specific student, it will become a student aim.  It is easier to handle a larger number of Aims that are smaller in size.  As you begin to create your Aims, consider that EVERY piece of curriculum needs to fit into an aim – for example, MAJOR, MINOR, GENED, CERTIFICATION, CONCENTRATION, *FREE, TOTAL CREDITS, EXPERIENTIAL, REMEDIAL, STATECORE, etc.     The four most common AIMS are MAJOR, GENED, *FREE, and TOTAL CREDITS.     In all probability, every student will need a MAJOR aim as well as general requirements (GENED).     You should always create a separate *FREE aim to accommodate anything that does not fit into any other aim – this is very important. This not only includes free electives but can also be an excellent troubleshooting tool.     The fourth most common aim across all institutions is TOTAL CREDITS, which is necessary to track the total amount of undisciplined credits. EX Advising Learning Guide   16  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Let’s take a behind-the-scenes look at some typical aim labels.  Student   Name:   Alan Anderson  Aim Label   Institutional Requirement   Advising Institutional Requirement Year  MAJOR   BIOMAJ   2011  GENED   05GENED   2011  TOTCR   TOTCR126   2011  *FREE   *FREE  The Advising Institutional Requirement Year can also be referred to as a Catalog Year. This is where you can identify the year as a substring, which can be associated with the IRQs and referred to an ancestry chain. This is how the Advising system recognizes that each BIOMAJ is different.  Every root is attached to a year for every student.  What is *Free?  You need to be sure that you have identified a *FREE aim that can be used as a bucket to hold courses that do not fit within any other aim. This aim can be very powerful and can also be utilized as a troubleshooting tool. For example, if you view a student’s Advising Worksheet (Psych Major) and the Psych 150 course (B+) appears within the *FREE aim, there is obviously a problem with your Advising tree.  A student cannot have more than one *FREE bucket attached to them at a single time.  You may very well have some free electives that must be taken by a student.  Your Liberal Arts program (124 hours) includes a set of electives (Photography, Art, etc.) of which 18 credits can be taken. If you set the *FREE aim with a minimum of 0 hours, you can define your BIOMAJ with 60 hours, GENED with 54 hours, and TOTCR with 124 hours. This will ensure that the student has met all of the requirements.  If you have several courses with a minimum of 3 hours, or the minute you take a course, you met the group requirement. Next semester, you take another course in the same group and the major requirement was met in the previous semester, so it would go into the *FREE.  What is #Admin?  The Administrative bucket works similarly to the *FREE bucket except it only catches courses that are forgiven or courses that do not fit into either the Programs or Free Electives area.  The #ADMIN bucket is not required, but if you do not set it up, you may lose visibility of some courses as they will drop off the Advising Worksheet or Graduation Report because there is no home for them in the Advising Trees. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  17  Chapter 5.   B UILDING   T REES  This chapter will focus on actually building trees by using the provided scenarios.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Build your own tree on paper    S UMMARY  Let’s continue using the concept of building trees in regards to the Advising module and take a closer look at the tree below for the Biology Major root (BIOMAJ).  What does this mean? Course 1, Course 2, and Course 3 are required courses. Now we will look at the other requirement – Group 1. Since this has an OR relationship, a student can successfully complete Course 4, Course 5, OR Group 2 which has an AND relationship for Course 6 and Course 7.  The Advising module will display Course 1, Course 2, Course 3, and Group 1 as required courses on the Graduation Report, Advising Worksheet, or any other report, window, and process. However, Course 6 and Course 7 will NOT be displayed as required even though its parent has an AND relationship. EX Advising Learning Guide   18  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Single vs. Multiple Root Systems  Let’s take a look of an Accounting Degree in a single root system.     ACCTMAJ – this parent has four children  o   FODREG (Foundational Requirements)  o   UPPRREG (Upper divisional Requirements)  o   GENELT (Electives) – you must define three with a star so let’s call this *FREE – the first thing you need to ask yourself is can any course actually be taken and applied towards the degree?  o   GENED (General Education)  Here is the tree for the Accounting Major.  The ACCTMAJ has an AND relationship with a minimum number of 120 hours. What does this mean? Everything must add up to 120 hours – however, since there is no maximum identified, a total of 133 hours can be earned, for example.     Child 1 has an AND relationship which means that all courses MUST be taken with a minimum number of 27 hours. Question: If a Spanish course has been waived, will the requirement be met? The answer is YES but how many hours will be applied towards that waiver? None. Therefore, only a possible 24 hours could be earned and the therefore the Child 1 requirement can never be met. In that case, two manual waivers (alterations) will need to be made in order to successfully complete this requirement.     Child 2 has a minimum of 24 hours and a minimum grade of B – this means that every course must have a minimum grade of B. Remember: Grades are assigned to courses.     Child 3 has a minimum of 24 hours.     Child 4 has an AND relationship which consists of individual courses and multiple groups – each group may have its own parent/child relationship with Child 4. Therefore, you may have a group called Literature consisting of several courses (minimum of 3), Religion consisting of several courses (minimum of 3), and Political Science/Philosophy (minimum 9).groups such as Literature (minimum of 3), means that all courses MUST be taken with a minimum number of 45 hours.  Now, if you decide to use a multiple root system, eliminate the top level (ACCTMAJ) and have each child become the parent. Another option would be to bring together Child 1 and Child 2 as one root and then have Child 3 and Child 4 as individual roots.  What identifies a course as being required rather than optional? There are two key components: the requirement must be the child of an AND parent, and the ancestry line, as it threads back to the root of the tree, must consist of ANDs at each level.

EX Advising Learning Guide   20  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Activity – Answer  Choose 9 hours from the following courses with each course being a 3-hour course and at least 6 hours must be identified with a 300+ level course:     PSY100 - PSY499     SOC100 - SOC499     ENG100 - ENG499  Where would you start and what do you know about this situation? What is important?  The first thing you need to do is create a group – let’s call the group Choose Courses. We already know that there is a 9 hour minimum. So our parent is called Choose Courses with a 9 hour minimum.  Now we need to create the children for this group.  One option would be that two sets of children are created – one for the 100 – 299 courses and the other for the 300 – 499 courses.  Is this an AND or an OR relationship? Well, as soon as you notice the words “...at least 6 hours must be...” you will know that this is an OR relationship.  Looking at our finished tree, you will see how we created the tree to fit the criteria that was originally established.  When working with maximum as opposed to minimum, consider using counts rather than hours. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  21  Activity     Build your own tree on the next page, and be sure that it shows the parent/child relationships. Using the steps below, you will understand the thought process that needs to be considered when building a tree.     Define a major  o   Starting with the root, we will refer to this as PSYMAJ – Psychology Major.  o   Consider this: Do you have various types of naming conventions? In other words, when you begin to build your PSYMAJ, do you have ARCs such as JEBYM, BELLO, and PSY150? Think about creating a naming convention that is easy to adhere to and one, which allows you to easily drag and drop when building your trees. Therefore, when building PSYMAJ, a more intuitive naming convention might be PSY101, PSY202, PSY303, etc.  In order to separate your ARCs from your IRQs, you can include another letter such  as PSYC for Psychology Concentration or PSYM for Psychology Major – you can also use PSYU for Undergraduate and PSYG for Graduate. Then your ARCs could begin with 5 characters.     Define the children of the major  o   Do you want to create a group under the parent called Major Requirements and then list the courses? Or would you rather place courses directly beneath the parent? Either method is fine – use your catalog and your guideline.  Consistency is critical across terms.     Add control mechanisms  o   Identify AND/OR relationships.  o   What about your minimums and maximums?  o   Will grades be a factor?  Consistency is critical across terms.     Define the next level of parent/child relationships  o   Work in levels – identify your children to the root and then children to the children, etc. EX Advising Learning Guide   22  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Draw your tree below: EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  23  Best Practices  Create a list of consistencies to ensure that everybody responsible for building trees will be able to follow these guidelines.  If you plan to use a disclaimer in your catalog, be sure the following three elements are clearly stated:     Reserve the right to change...     At any time...     Without notification...  Every institution should have a statement of responsibility such as...     Students: Please note that you are solely and only responsible for your own successful progress and completion in the degree requirements you select. While advisors are available to help with course selection, you are the only individual responsible for whether or not you graduate.  Consider the manner in which information is communicated to students – be concise and clear – use lists and bullet formats. This will eliminate various types of interpretations.     Are your advisors required to sign a course selection sheet during registration? Why?     Are you aware that any document that is officially signed and not disclaimed as part of the contract generally becomes part of the contract?     If your advisors are signing course selection sheets, this indicates that a meeting has occurred between the student and advisor.

C ONFIGURING   A DVISING  While the majority of configuration in Advising is directly related to the development of specialized curriculum plans to meet the requirements of all students, there are a few components that need to be defined.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Configure the Advising module and define the components to fit your specific needs     Change Advising Requirement Codes     Build a tree within the Advising software     Assign profiles to a student     Activate advisees     Synchronize advisor and advisee information     Create a degree aim cross reference between the Advising and Registration modules  S UMMARY  Let’s begin by taking a look at the   Advising Configuration   window.  Official set of advisors for a student (values are AV or RE)     You may use either the Advising module (the Advisor Student table) or the Registration module (the Student division Master table) to determine where the system looks for a student’s advisors.  Use approval track for alterations     You may decide to only allow student alterations if they are approved. In that case, if you choose Y, any alteration will be displayed on windows and reports with a graphic indicating that the alteration has not yet been approved and, once approved, the warning graphic will no longer appear. If you choose N, this indicates that no approval is required. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  25  Calculate GPA for Major, Minor, Concentration, Concentration     This configuration is used to activate the Program GPA Profiles functionality. You may associate a list of courses and cumulative course type advising requirements with majors, minors, concentrations, and certifications as defined in the Registration module. Each time these majors, minors, concentrations, or certifications are assigned to or modified for a student in the  Registration Student Information   window, the software will add the GPA profile to the student in Advising. Therefore, if you track Major and Minor GPA, you will want to choose Y for this configuration. If you choose N, no updates will be performed in the Advising module.  Automatically update Advising from Registration     Each time information is added, or changed in the   Student Information   window from Registration, the Advising module will be updated. For instance, a new student is added to the Student tab, advisors are added or changed on the Student Division tab or majors, minors, concentrations or certifications are added or changed on the Degree tab. You should only turn this configuration to Y after the cross references have been established.  Default Organization Code     Although you can choose any organization code to be displayed in the Advising module, we recommend that *Local always be used.  Place forgiven course work in free elective bucket     You can determine whether forgiven courses will appear in a free elective bucket on the requirements tree. If you select   N , the forgiven course will be ignored and not appear anywhere in a requirements tree or report. If you do not track free electives, select   N   for this item.  Apply unsatisfactory course to requirement until forgiven     If you choose N, an unsatisfactory course completion that does not satisfy a requirement will not be applied towards the student and will fall into the free elective bucket. No credit will be applied to the requirement. When the student repeats the course, the requirement will appear “IN PROGRESS” with no indication that the student had taken the course previously.     If you choose Y, an unsatisfactory course completion that does not satisfy their requirement will be applied towards the student and will remain until the student successfully repeats the course. The grade will be applied to the requirement and, when the student repeats the course, the unsatisfactory grade will remain with the text “REPEAT” appearing in the Reason Not Met column for the requirement. Once the student successfully completes the course, the credit will be applied to the requirement and the forgiven course will drop to the free electives bucket.  Would you like to Utilize “When MET then MET”?     If you choose N, you do not want to allow users to use the “When MET then MET” functionality.     If you choose Y, users are allowed to place courses already MET in a Group. This option will allow the   When Met Then Met   option to function, closing the requirements once a group or root has been met. The advising engine will re-direct any additional courses that might have been added to that requirement and place the course(s) in another location.  You can still choose to turn off this feature on individual groups from the institutional requirements tree.  Number of AV Meeting notes to display on the AV worksheet     You may choose to display any number of Advising meeting notes (in descending order) on the Advising Worksheet by entering the number here. If you do not choose to have any notes displayed, enter zero for the number. EX Advising Learning Guide   26  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Number of AV Notepad notes to display on the AV Worksheet     You may choose to display any number of Notepad notes (in descending order) on the Advising Worksheet by entering the number here.  An Advisor can only view notes on students for which they have been assigned.  Notepad security only allows notes to be accessed through the module – that is, if you are using Advising, your notes will not be able to be viewed in Registration.  Defining the components  Before discussing individual components, understand the manner in which these components are used within the Advising module.  Information within the Advising module is used to determine the institutional requirements that need to be met by each student in order to successfully complete a requirement and graduate. Every course that is offered by a school is identified by an advising requirement code (ARC) which, in turn, is associated with a requirement type and linked to a cluster code. All of these components are used to establish the manner in which courses and their credits are applied towards students. This example demonstrates the various components that will need to be defined for your courses in order for the Advising module to be effective:  Courses   Introduction to Biology  Fundamentals of Biology  Science of Living Organisms  ARC   BIO101   BIO201   BIO301  Requirement Type   ROOT   CRS   CRS   CRS  Cluster Code   R   C   C   C  AIM   GENBIO   BIOELT  So, in the general scheme of configuring your Advising module, the following process will occur:  1   Identify your course offerings  2   Assign an Advising Requirement Code (ARC) code to each course  3   Associate an Advising requirement type to each ARC  4   Choose a cluster code to further define the characteristics of a requirement type which will determine the manner in which a requirement is evaluated (you cannot choose a cluster code without having an Advising requirement type)  5   Build your AIMS  You cannot split any type of ARC at any time.  The subsequent topics will assist you in understanding each of these components in order to successfully configure the Advising module to fit your specific needs. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  27  Accessing the Module  In addition to the Task List security, there is also an additional layer of security built into the Advising module that requires every user to belong to one of three roles – this is unique to Advising. Their roles will determine the type of access that will be assigned to you as well as the menu options that will be displayed in the software.     An Administrator has access to all menu options as well as the ability to define components, view information on advisors and students, and assign students to advisors  o   You may need to assign this role to a few individuals – in this case, you may want to use the Tasklist security to remove certain functions – set up groups and work with your IT staff to customize their accessibility to features within the software     An Advisor can only view information directly related to their assigned students  o   Advisors will not have the ability to see trees – this option will not be available from the menu     A Student can only view information about themselves  o   With the Web tools available, you may want to only allow students to use the Web to view information about themselves rather than actually accessing the Advising software  When you log into the Advising module, the security verification will determine your role and will provide you the required access. Every user of the module must be set up with one of these roles by the Advising Administrator to be able to log into the module.  To assign access...  1   Go to the   Maintain Advising Access   window  2   Right-click and select   Add Row  3   Enter each person’s login, ID number, and choose the appropriate access from the drop-down menu EX Advising Learning Guide   28  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Characterizing Requirements  As mentioned earlier, the main component in the Advising module is the Advising Requirement Code, otherwise known as an ARC. Every ARC that exists within Advising must be identified with a specific type (and, in turn, with a cluster code) so that the system knows how to characterize the ARC.  You can define any number of requirement types that will fit your needs. Each type can consist of as many as 5 characters. Consider your choices and create requirement types that will work with your institutional organization.  While the requirement types can consist of any 5 characters you choose, the cluster codes cannot be changed since they are actually used to determine how the requirement is evaluated by the Advising system. Therefore, you may choose to create requirement types that are very similar to the cluster codes that will be associated with them. Let’s examine them in detail to further understand their characteristics.     Course – C  o   This requirement is satisfied by the completion of course work.     Group – G  o   This is the parent of a collection of child requirements. It must also be associated with a group relation type code to determine the relationship of the child requirements.     Course Total – CT  o   This requirement reports an unduplicated total of all credits that a student has earned.     Cumulative Credit – CC  o   This requirement specifies that it may accumulate credit each time a course is successfully repeated. For example, this requirement would be appropriate for a music practice course where a student may take the same one-credit hour course each semester for five semesters. A requirement with this cluster code will report five credit hours for the repeated course. This is the only way multiple credits can be applied towards a single ARC.     Root – R  o   A Root requirement is attached to student aims. All roots automatically have a group relation type of AND.     Other – O  o   This cluster code specifies that a requirement is not automatically evaluated. It is satisfied by placing a record in the Student Advising Alterations table for the requirement with any credit or status information to be applied to the requirement.  Now that the cluster codes have been explained, you may find it easier to create your requirement types. As mentioned earlier, you can simply create requirement types that replicate the name as its cluster code. For example:  Requirement  Type Code  Requirement  Type Description  Cluster  Code  How is it used in Advising ?  CRS   Course   C   Any requirement identified with this requirement type will be satisfied by the completion of course work  GROUP   Group   G   Parent of a group of child requirements  CRSTO   Course Total   CT   Total of unduplicated credits  CUMCR   Cumulative Credit   CC   Credit can be accumulated each time the course is successfully repeated  ROOT   Root   R   Root requirement attached to student aims EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  29  As you can see, you can hardly talk about Advising requirement types without also including the cluster code. While most schools will already have these codes defined, you may not have the ability to make any changes but you can certainly add new requirement types. For example, you want to distinguish the difference between undergraduate and graduate courses by assigning different requirement types. The advantage to this methodology is that you will be able to run reports or queries using these specific data elements.  Use Caution in adding new requirement types when inheriting a fully functional system.  To define requirement types...  1   Go to the   Maintain Advising Requirement Types   window  2   Right-click and select   Add Row  3   Enter a type  4   Enter a description  5   Choose its corresponding cluster code  6   Choose a number for Print Order  o   This will determine the order in which the items will be printed; that is, you will probably want the Roots to be displayed first, followed by Groups, and then followed by Courses, with the Total as the final item. This uses the same scheme as the order within a tree structure. The lower numbers will appear higher on the report and you may want to identify numbers in increments of 5 or 10. This will affect both the Advising Worksheet as well as the Graduation Audit.  7   Choose a priority number between 1 and 10  o   This will be used when determining how a requirement is evaluated when it appears in more than one instance – 1 indicates the highest priority and 10 indicates the lowest priority. Recommendation is to assign a priority number of 5 to provide some flexibility for reuse. EX Advising Learning Guide   30  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  8   If the   Display   checkbox is selected, the information will be displayed within the Advising software.  9   If the   Print   checkbox is selected, the information will be printed in reports.   In most cases, you will want to select this checkbox.  10   You can enter only 26 characters here as a Comment which will only be visible to the person viewing this window within the Advising software.  11   Click the   Save   icon when all of your selections have been made.  After you have defined your requirement types, you can now create your advising requirements.  To define advising requirements...  1   Go to the   Maintain Advising Requirements   window  This is the ARC table – remember this paragraph from a previous section of this document...  Within the Advising system, everything is built either on the ARC table or on the TREE table. Roots, groups, courses, etc. reside on the ARC table – basically, PSY150 is just PSY150 on the ARC table. Now, when PSY150 becomes part of a tree, this ARC will now become a requirement for the PSYMAJ. Whereas the ARC table is global, the TREE table is local. Understanding this theory will help you determine where to implement changes to obtain the appropriate results.  2   Right-click and select   Add Row  3   Enter an ARC EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  31  4   Enter a description  5   Select a type – its corresponding cluster code will automatically be applied  6   Select the remaining characteristics of the ARC  To change advising requirements...  1   Click on a row  2   Right-click and select   Advising Requirement Detail  3   Make necessary changes or add new details  If you are not sure about the Grade Scale and Credit Type, only enter the Grade in the last column and leave the others blank.  4   Right-click and select   Rename Advising Requirement Code  5   Enter new code and click the   OK   button  You may want to select the Rename Advising Requirement Code option for two reasons: the existing name is incorrect or the course number needs to be changed.  When you make any changes to existing ARCs here, the following dialog box will appear:  There are several options here – remember to view the checkboxes that have been selected and either remove or add checkboxes depending on the information you want to update. If the respective checkbox is not selected, the information will not be updated.     If you click the   Yes   button, the system will reach out from the ARC table and change every single instance on every tree that contains this ARC. This option progresses one row (ARC) at a time. This is a global change. EX Advising Learning Guide   32  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt     If you click the   Yes to All   button, only the rows of information that have changed based on the checkmarks will be updated. This option will make the same changes (as defined by the checkboxes you have selected) for every row you have changed.     If you click the   No   button, the changes will be saved to the ARC table but will not be pushed out to the trees – therefore, the next time you build a tree with the ARC, the changes will be reflected using the updated ARC.  You cannot change the ARC Type once a Root or Group has been embedded into a tree. You will have to remove the ARC from the tree and start the building process over.  Once something is on the Student Course History, no changes will impact the information that has been saved there from previous courses. Therefore, academic history is not changed by anything.  To build a tree...  1   Choose the   Institutional Requirement Trees   window  2   Select the year for which the institutional requirements tree will be established  3   Click on either the   Requirements   or   Catalog   radio button from the   Available Requirements   group box on the   Requirement Detail   tab  All of your courses will appear on the bottom right of the window as illustrated below. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  33  4   Drag and drop from the requirements data window on the right to the requirements tree on the left.   You may use Shift+click to select a range of rows or Ctrl+click to select multiple rows.  5   Click the Save icon when all of your selections have been made  Remember to drop the root requirements onto the requirement tree first and then add the necessary groups and courses to the root.  As the institutional requirements tree is being created, you may use the   Copy ,   Move ,   Paste , and   Delete  right-click options.  The   Print Tree   button in the upper right of the window will become available as soon as a requirement has been selected from the institutional requirements tree view. This will enable you to preview and print a report showing the parent/child relationship of the requirement as well as the requirement details.  Use the   Copy Tree(s)   button to display the   Copy Institutional Requirement Tree(s)   window, which allows you to copy one or all institutional requirement trees from one year to another.  Creating Advisor Relationships  You may want to create and identify various types of relationships between students and advisors. For example, a student may be assigned to one Major advisor, a separate General advisor, and yet another advisor who specializes in Title III grants. These relationships can also be used very effectively in mail merge letters. In any case, you can use Advisor Types to distinguish these various relationships between advisors and students.  Keep it simple – and remember that these relationships must be maintained and accurate in order for them to be beneficial.  To identify advisor types...  1   Open the   Maintain Advisor Types   window  2   Right-click and select   Add Row EX Advising Learning Guide   34  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  3   Enter a type  4   Enter a description  5   You can only enter 30 characters here as a Comment, which will only be visible to the person viewing this window within the Advising software.  6   Click the   Save   icon when all of your selections have been made.  These relationships can then be identified when you assign students to advisors or when you assign advisors to students from the following windows:     Assign Students to Advisors     Maintain Advisees (enter a student ID number, right-click to select   Advisors for Students )  Using Manual Alterations  When you utilize the manual alterations process, you must have at least two ‘requirement met by’ types: Waive and Substitute. Every other situation is essentially based on a form of one of these two types.  A requirement that is waived does not earn credits whereas a requirement that is substituted for another does earn credits.  One other type that is recommended should be used for bypass purposes – mainly for the benefit of re- use. Typically, the amount of courses that are part of the re-use string represents a step along the way – the bypass ‘requirement met by’ type will allow you to manually alter a re-use string so that it ignores one of those steps.  After adding an alteration, you must perform a recalc in order for the alteration to be applied.  Remember: Manual alterations are just that – manual. You will probably want to perform as few as possible. The alteration will only last as long as the student is attached to the aim – therefore, if the student changes majors and then returns to their original major, all of the manual alterations will disappear.  For the purposes of CLEP, Military Credit, etc., create organizat ions on the  Organization Master and consider them as transfer institutions. This is the preferred method to use for such situations. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  35  To define ‘requirement met by’ types...  1   Select the   Maintain Requirement Met By Types   window  2   Right-click and select   Add Row  3   Enter a type (up to 6 characters)  4   Enter a description  5   Choose the   Reference Required   checkbox to indicate that a substitute requirement code needs to be entered in order to satisfy the requirement  o   When the manual alteration is made and this type is used, the   Enter Overrides/Course Substitution   window will be displayed and you will be asked to provide the substitute requirement code  6   Click the   Save   icon when all of your selections have been made  Once your Met By Types have been created, you will be able to use these codes when making alterations for students.  Identifying Aim Labels  We have already discussed AIMS and how they are assigned to students. Now we will look at how you can create specific aim labels to identify certain goals.  You must be sure that your entire curriculum fits into one of these aim labels.  You will surely want to have an aim label called MAJOR; however, the contents within that aim label will vary depending on the student’s individual requirements.  For illustration purposes, we will use the aim label called MAJOR for two different students.  Student A:   English Major   Student B:   Art Major  Aim Label: Major   Aim Label: Major  Completion of a minimum of 51 credits which must include the following:  Completion of a minimum of 60 credits which must include the following:  English Composition   9 credits   Art History   9 credits  Communication   6 credits   Studio Art   42 credits  Grammar   6 credits   Fine Art Electives   9 credits  Literature   30 credits  Total   51 credits   Total   60 credits  As you can see from the illustration, the aim label of MAJOR was assigned to both students, which produced very different results. The MAJOR aim label for Student A was assigned the ARC of ENGMAJ which serves as the root requirement and will be used as the source for evaluating requirements. The same holds true for Student B with the root requirement of ARTMAJ. EX Advising Learning Guide   36  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  If a student has not yet selected a specific major, the student may have an aim label with no ARC.  You may want to use the same name to identify both the requirement type and the aim label. In this case, all requirements designated as the root of a degree major tree will have both a requirement type and an aim label called MAJOR. Therefore, when selecting advising requirement codes to satisfy an aim of MAJOR, all requirements with a type of MAJOR will be obvious.  With this in mind, you may want to identify aim labels called MAJOR, MINOR, CORE, etc. If a student has more than one major, this will allow you to assign two MAJOR aim labels with a different set of requirements to the student.  We recommend that you do not use MAJOR1, MAJOR2, etc. due to the fact that the degree aim cross reference process will look at everything called MAJOR and, if a student has two, they will be compared. Therefore, the MAJOR2 requirements will not be evaluated.  To create aim labels...  1   Go to the   Maintain Aim Labels   window  2   Right-click and select   Add Row  3   Enter a type (up to 6 characters)  4   Enter a description EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  37  5   Click on the   Status   checkbox to activate the aim label  6   Remember to print an Advising Worksheet, you must have one active AIM – this is where you can set all of the AIMs to active.  7   Choose an aim type  8   If the   Print   checkbox is selected, the information will be printed in reports.   In most cases, you will want to select this checkbox.  9   If the   Display   checkbox is selected, the information will be displayed within the Advising software.  10   Choose a number for Print Order  o   This will determine the order in which the items will be printed; that is, you will probably want the Roots to be displayed first, followed by Groups, and then followed by Courses, with the Total as the final item. This uses the same scheme as the order within a tree structure. The lower numbers will appear higher on the report and you may want to identify numbers in increments of 5 or 10. This will affect both the Advising Worksheet as well as the Graduation Audit.  11   Click the   Save   icon when all of your selections have been made  Maintaining Program GPA Profiles  When courses are associated to programs such as majors, minors, concentrations, and certifications, these associations become known as Program GPA Profiles. Then, when these programs are identified with a student in Registration, all of the Program GPA Profiles that have been associated with the program will automatically be applied to the student.  This information for a student is pulled from the Degree History in Registration where Degree History is identified as Current.  When using this feature, remember that the Advising Worksheet or Graduation Report  will not display both graduate and undergraduate work when only one division can be identified as current. EX Advising Learning Guide   38  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  To define profiles...  1   Go to the   Maintain Program GPA Profiles   window  2   Select an academic year  3   Select the appropriate radio button for the element to be defined  4   Drag and drop the major, minor, concentration, or certification from the right side of the window onto the tree displayed on the left  5   Now use the drag and drop feature again to select available courses and assign them to the program on the left  After you have defined your profiles, you can now assign them to students. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  39  To assign profiles to a student...  1   Open the   Maintain Advisees   window  2   Enter a student ID, right-click to select   Program GPA Profiles for Student   option  The   Program GPA Profiles for Student   window will appear.  3   Select an element to drag and drop onto the appropriate branch of the tree view – very similar to the process used when the Program GPA was first defined. EX Advising Learning Guide   40  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You may want to make changes to the profile for an individual student by using the same drop and drag feature for individual courses.  4   To preserve these individual changes and avoid having them be over-written if the profile changes, right-click on the program from the tree view and select the   Lock GPA Profile   option  While this feature is useful for creating standard program GPA profiles, it is also flexible enough to allow individual changes to be made for students.  Working with your Institutional Requirements  The establishment of your institutional requirements will vary depending on your course catalog and your course offerings. As you begin to identify curriculum and graduation needs, your institutional requirements will develop.  Evaluation criteria may be specified for a particular occurrence of a requirement that has been defined as the child. While the criteria for meeting this requirement is determined by what has been defined for this child, the criteria can also be overridden for a particular occurrence within the institutional requirement.  If the requirement BIOELT has a minimum GPA requirement of 3.0 and is used as a child of GENBIO, it is possible to change the required minimum GPA value for BIOELT to another value such as 2.5 by specifying a GPA value of 2.5 for the instance of BIOELT as it appears in the definition of GENBIO. If BIOELT is used anywhere else, it will still default to a GPA requirement of 3.0 unless overridden wherever it appears as part of another instance.  You can associate your root level requirements for a specific year, creating parent/child relationships and thereby building an institutional requirement tree.  Remember that only Root or Group requirements can be selected as parents. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  41  To build institutional requirements...  1   Go to the   Institutional Requirement Trees   window  You will notice two tabs:   Requirement Detail   and   Options . Depending on the tab that you select, a different set of elements will be displayed related to the requirement that is selected in the lower right section of the window.  2   Enter a year  o   You can either view all of the trees for a specific year or select one by choosing the root from the Requirements drop-down menu  3   Click the   Find Now   button  4   Either click on the   Requirements   or   Catalog   radio button to determine the manner in which the requirements will be displayed in the bottom right portion of the window.  o   If you choose Requirements, the data will be displayed by requirement code, description, type, group relation, and hours needed.  o   If you choose Catalog, the data will be displayed by course code, course title, and credit hours. EX Advising Learning Guide   42  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  5   You can now begin to drag and drop from the bottom right section of the window to the upper left section of the window beneath your institutional requirements tree – start with the root, then your major requirements, electives, and core.  This is where you are establishing your parent/child relationships – if you created your bubble trees on paper, this is where you will be able to actually build your trees within the Advising module.  As you begin to drag, take a few seconds before actually dropping to make sure that everything have been brought over and placed onto the correct parent.  6   Continue building your tree by dragging and dropping your courses onto the requirements.  7   If you need to remove a requirement from one of your trees, right-click on the requirement and select the   Delete Requirement   option EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  43  Notice the highlighted box below – let’s take a closer look at the   Requirement Detail   tab that displays information (which can be edited) from the Advising tree table.  The information displayed here is specific to the year and tree – therefore, if this same requirement appears in another year or tree, these changes will not be reflected in every instance.  1   Language Options have been highlighted; therefore, the requirement details are displayed for that group.  2   You will see that the Count Needed is 1.   This indicates that one of the child requirements identified with Language Options needs to be taken.  3   Examining more details in the highlighted box, you’ll notice that the Type shows that this is a Group and the relation is OR – since there are two children associated with Language Options (French and Spanish), the student will need to take any one of these child requirements.  4   Each child requirement is also a Group with an AND relation – therefore, once a specific Group has been selected, the student will need to take all courses identified with the French or Spanish groups.  5   The When Met, load courses until MAX checkbox provides a way to indicate at a specific Group level that you want to continue to apply course requirements (up to the Maximum allowed) even though the group has been met. EX Advising Learning Guide   44  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Notice the highlighted box below – let’s take a closer look at the   Options   tab.  1   The Priority Number is used when determining how a requirement is evaluated when it appears in more than one instance - 1 indicates the highest priority and 10 indicates the lowest priority.  2   The Print Order determines the order in which the items will be printed; that is, you will probably want the Roots to be displayed first, followed by Groups, and then followed by Courses, with the Total as the final item.   This uses the same scheme as the order within a tree structure.   The lower numbers will appear higher on the report and you may want to identify numbers in increments of 5 or 10.   This will affect both the Advising Worksheet as well as the Graduation Audit.  o   You will not identify a print order for individual courses. The Compute Student Progress process loads the courses in the specific order in which they were taken by the student based on the Year Definition sort order, Term Definition sort order and Student Course History student sequence number. The Print Order should only be considered for your Roots and Groups.  3   Depending on the student’s ability to take the same requirement more than one time, click on the   Allow Reuse   checkbox.   The Allow Reuse applies to course requirement ARCs only.  4   If the   Display   checkbox is selected, the information will be displayed within the Advising software. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  45  5   If the   Print   checkbox is selected, the information will be printed in reports.   In most cases, you will want to select this checkbox.  6   The Requirement Text section can be used to display specific information on the Advising Worksheet.  7   A nested argument within the Advising Worksheet indicates that Requirement Text will be displayed if it exists – if not, the ARC description will be displayed.   For example, you may want to enter the following Requirement Text:  o   Please choose three requirements from the following choices: PSY125-175, PSY189-222, and PSY250-280.  8   Click on the   Print Tree   button to preview and print a report showing the parent/child relationship of the requirement as well as the requirement details.   This will help you troubleshoot any possible issues that may become apparent later.  Once you have created your institutional requirements for the selected year (which is a very time- consuming task), you will have a structure on which future years can be based.  To copy one or more trees...  1   Right-click on a tree that appears beneath Institutional Requirement Trees and select the   Copy Tree   or   Move Tree   option  2   Enter the Year and Requirement for which this tree will be copied or moved  3   Click on the   Replace Existing Tree(s)   checkbox if you would like to replace the existing tree  4   Click the   OK   button  5   If necessary, you can now make changes to the tree that was just copied  If the requirement already exists, it will be displayed in UPPER CASE letters as shown in the screen capture above, and the system will not permit you to save this same requirement in lower case letters.  Why would you want to copy a tree? As well as being able to copy an existing tree to the following year, you can also copy a tree backwards to a previous year. This may be helpful when you are in the process of going live – you can build trees for several years – or you can also create a miniature test environment. EX Advising Learning Guide   46  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  To create a test environment for Advising...  1   Speak with your Registrar to discuss using a specific naming convention for your test environment with Advising  2   Create a new year in the Registration module called   AVTEST or AVTREE so that it is clearly identifiable  3   Select the   Institutional Requirement Trees   window  4   Select the new year that was created in Registration  5   Build your trees and assign students to the requirements  6   Generate Advising Worksheets and Graduation Reports for the students to which the requirements have been assigned  7   Verify that the system is processing the requirements correctly – this is an excellent method for troubleshooting problems before they arise in your production environment  8   If you need to make changes to your test year, click on the   Copy Trees   button and be sure to select the   Replace Existing Trees   checkbox on the   Copy Institutional Requirement Tree(s)   window  9   Continue testing until you are sure that the desired results are being achieved  Using the Advisor Master  Your advisors must exist in the Advisor Master before any functions can be performed. It is recommended that you enter your Advisors on the   Maintain Advisors   window in Advising and then synchronize this information with the Faculty Master in Registration (for more details on this process, see the topic Synchronizing Information below).  To add an advisor...  1   Open the   Maintain Advisors   window  Let’s take a minute to look at this window.     The top portion of the window is the Search By area – this can be used to search for an advisor by ID number, name, location, building, or type. Before adding a new advisor to the system, you will want to verify that the name does not already exist – avoid duplicates as much as possible.  o   The left side of the window will display a list of current advisors in the system.  o   To edit existing information, highlight a name and click on the   Name Entity   button on the right – here you can make changes to the Name Master.  o   To view a list of advisees assigned to the advisor, click on the   Advisees   button.  o   Click on the   Notepad   button to add a note for the advisor.  o   Click on the   Office Lookup   button to view a list of valid locations and buildings.     The Advisor Detail section in the middle of the window can be used to modify existing information or to select details when adding a new Advisor to the system. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  47  2   Click the   Add Advisor   button from the right section of the window  3   Enter the advisor’s name and other details  4   Select the appropriate checkboxes to determine the Advisor’s ability to authorize courses  5   Click the   Save   icon when all of your selections have been made  When you click on the Delete Advisor button, all information will be removed for the advisor including advisees. This information cannot be retrieved so choose this option with care.  The advisor will now be able to view his/her advisees.  Rather than having Advisors use the Advising software, utilize the Web tools since they are more intuitive.  Deactivating Advisors and Advisees  You can 'deactivate' an advisor (which will also deactivate any advisor/advisee relationships) by removing the checkmark from the   Active   checkbox at the bottom of the   Maintain Advisors   window. However, before this can be done, the following two conditions must be met:     You will need to deactivate the advisor from any Advising Groups     You will need to be sure that the advisor is not identified as the Primary Advisor to any advisees – if so, you can remove the Primary designation and assign a different number to the advisor which will then allow you to deactivate the advisor EX Advising Learning Guide   48  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Now, all relationships to which the advisor was assigned, as well as the advisor, will become inactive. You can also deactivate advisees for an advisor by clicking on the   Advisees   button from the   Maintain Advisors   window.  As illustrated in the screen capture below, you will notice that Sarah Lively (advisor) is assigned to two advisees. In this case, if you remove the   Active   checkbox for Annissa Nicole Robinson, keep in mind that you will only be deactivating the relationship between this specific advisor and advisee. Therefore, if Annissa was assigned to other advisors, those relationships would remain active.  Changes made here will be saved to the Advising History table.  Activating Advisees  In order for the Advising module to function properly, you must have the following three key elements:     Trees     Advisees     Advisors  Even if you have matriculating students in Registration, these students will not be considered Advisees until they have been activated as such.  The Advising system recognizes Advisees by their name type – this is the method used to classify individuals and identify their roles within the system. While the Registration module identifies students (the role of STU) as soon as they have been assigned to a division, an Advisee is identified through one of the following methods:     Added through the   Maintain All Advisees   window     Performing the Synchronize Advisee Information process     Selecting students via Degree Aim Cross Reference EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  49  To activate advisees...  1   Go to the   Maintain All Advisees   window  2   You may click on the   Find Now   button or press the Enter key to display all students enrolled in the current student division – until you have done so no information will be displayed  3   Use either the   Advising   or   Registration   tab to filter your search criteria  4   For example, to select students with a GENED aim, use the Advising tab, select GENED from the Aim drop-down menu, and click the   Find Now   button.   To select first year students, use the Registration tab, select from the Class drop-down menu, and click the   Find Now   button  5   On the Advising tab, click on the   Active ,   Inactive , or   All   radio button to display students with the appropriate status  6   Click on the   New Search   button to clear the criteria and begin another search EX Advising Learning Guide   50  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  There are several right-click options available from this window.  7   Highlight a row and right-click  8   You can quickly access several details for the student by choosing one of the available options  When you choose the Delete Row option, all advisee information will be removed for the student; therefore, choose this option with care.  To add an advisee...  Before adding an advisee, right-click on the ID number field and select   Advanced Search  1   Right-click and select   Add Row  2   Enter the student’s ID number, etc.  3   Click the   Save   icon when all of your selections have been made EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  51  Synchronizing Information  There is a fundamental difference between the following two processes:     Synchronize Advisor Information     Synchronize Advisee Information  Information from Registration is created or updated in Advising when the Synchronize Advisor Information process occurs.  1   Select a query on the   General   tab to choose specific faculty to create or update their information in Advising from the data that was entered in Registration on the Faculty Master table.  2   Select from the two options on the   Options   tab to choose the faculty information to be updated.  3   Create Advisor Information will update the Advisor Master if the individual does not yet exist.  4   Synchronize Advisor Information with Faculty Master will update the Advisor Master with information that is available in the Faculty Master.  If you select the   Synchronize Advisor Information with Faculty Master   checkbox, the three authorization columns between Advisor Master and Faculty Master will also be updated. If the advisor is not active but exists in the Faculty Master, the advisor will become active.  You must select at least one checkbox above in order for the process to be performed.  On the other hand, the Synchronize Advisee Information process will clear everything out of the existing tables and then rebuild or recreate the information. Therefore, if you have not yet configured the Degree Aim Cross Reference for all of your students and performed the Synchronize Advisee Information process, all information will be cleared out and will not be able to be re-created. Once the Degree Aim Cross Reference is configured, you will be able to run this process ONE TIME and there will be no need to run it again.  It is important to remember that everything will be cleared out the existing tables when the Synchronize Advisee Information process is performed. Therefore, you will need to be able to recreate this information through the Degree Aim Cross Reference feature. EX Advising Learning Guide   52  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  5   Select a query on the   General tab   to choose specific students to create or update their information in Advising from the data that was entered in Registration.  6   Select from the following options on the   Options   tab to choose the student information to be created or updated.  7   Create Advisee Information   will create the Advisee Master if the individual does not yet exist.  8   Synchronize with Student Division Master   will delete all information in the Advisor Student relationship table and re-create the data from the Advisor information on the Student Division Master.   If the process needs to create an Advisor Student relationship row and the Advisor does not exist, a row will be added to the Advisor Master using the information from the Faculty Master.  9   Current Division Only   will create information based on the student’s current division. If this checkbox is not selected, the Advisor Student relationship information will be created or updated for all Student Division Master rows.  10   Synchronize Aims with Degree History   will delete aims for each student selected in the query and the synchronize process will rebuild the student aims based on the mapping defined on the Degree Aim Cross Reference window.  11   Synchronize GPA Profiles with Degree History   will delete Program GPA Profiles for the selected students in the query and the synchronize process will rebuild the profiles based on the mapping defined on the Maintain Program GPA Profiles window.  Anytime a record is deleted or added through the Synchronize Advisee Information process, the relationship is also updated in the Advising History table.  You must select at least one checkbox above in order for the process to be performed. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  53  Setting up the CREATEAV Functionality  The CREATEAV functionality is an automated way of creating or updating student Advising data based on information that has been added or changed for the specific student on the Student Information window. The data flow is one way – from Registration to Advising. The data does not flow from Advising to Registration.  The following steps must be performed in order to successfully implement the CREATEAV functionality:  1   Registration data must be complete and accurate  2   Configure the Degree Aim Cross Reference table  3   Run the   Synchronize Advisee Information   process ONE MORE TIME with one exception:   if you are going live for the first time, only run this process ONCE  4   On the   Advising Configuration   window, set the value to “Y” for the Automatically update Advising from Registration configuration item  Before considering the CREATEAV feature, you must build your trees, test them, and be sure that they are accurate. Once your decision has been made, you can begin to move forward with the set up. Let’s take a closer look at each of these steps.  Registration data must be complete and accurate  Tracking a student’s advisor(s) on the Student Division Master table in Registration will automatically create the Advisor Student relationship rows in Advising.  1   Open the   Student Information   window and click on the   Student Division   tab.  2   Identify the advisors for a student here.   If you create them in the Advising module, the advisor information will not synchronize back to Registration and will therefore be overwritten whenever these advisors are changed in Registration.   You may assign additional advisors over 3 in Advising.   Remember that this information will not be part of the synchronization process.  If you make any changes to an Advisor on the Student Division tab and the Advisor exists in the Advisor Master table, the changes will also be displayed on the Advising tab – real time. EX Advising Learning Guide   54  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You will also want the system to look at the Degree History table in Registration in order to know which aims to attach to the student in Advising.  3   Select the   Student Information   window and click on the   Degree   tab.  4   Select the student’s Major, Minor, Certification, and Concentration on this window.  5   Select the student’s Advising Institution Requirement Year on the window.  6   If you need to perform this step for several students, you can easily run a query that will basically “select the Advising Requirement Year from the Student Master entrance year and insert it into the Advising Institutional Requirement Year” since this will be true for most of your students. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  55  Configure the Degree Aim Cross Reference table  Once the cross reference has been established between an Advising Year, Element Type (Major, Minor, Concentration, or Certification), and an Advising Aim, you will only need to select the Year and Element Type on the   Degree   tab in Registration. When a student’s Degree Program and Advising IRQ Year correspond to a mapped Advising Year and Element Type, the system will automatically create the aims for the student in Advising.  After the cross reference has been defined, you will be able to copy the configuration from one year to another.  1   Go to the   Maintain Degree Aim Cross Reference   window  2   Right-click and select   Add Row  3   Select a year and an element type  4   On the bottom portion of the window, right-click and select   Add Row  5   Choose an AIM and a Requirement to be associated with the element type that was selected above  6   Select the   Primary   checkbox if the AIM is associated with the Major – this will allow you to use reporting tools to identify these AIMS  7   For double Majors, do not select the   Primary   checkbox for any AIMS  8   Click the   Save   icon when all of your selections have been made  Unlike Concentrations, Minors assume no connection with the Major. EX Advising Learning Guide   56  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Let’s take a look at these element types.  In Registration, you may have a Major in Business Administration with a Concentration in Marketing. The Major will be created as a cross reference and the Concentration will further identify what is needed. In this particular situation, you would not build a Business Administration Major but rather a Business Administration Concentration. Remember that you don’t need to cross reference a Major to a Major – basically whatever will deliver the resulting aims is the end result. It is definitely acceptable to build your largest set of aims from the Concentration.  Degree is another area for consideration. Does your institution support BA, BS, MA, MS, etc.? The Major code will not be distinguishable enough to identify the set of aims to be attached to each degree. One solution is to change the Major codes. In this particular instance, English would be identified with BAENG, BSENG, MAENG, MSENG, etc. Create a code at the Major/Minor level that is specific enough to know which aims need to be attached to it. Only use on description – in this case, ENG. If you do not have unique codes, you will not be able to use the degree aim cross reference. Then, the BAENG will be displayed in the Major field on the Degree Programs section of the   Student Information   window in Registration.  If you have Major codes that are the same for multiple degrees, you will need to change your codes before using the degree aim cross reference.  Run the Synchronize Advisee Information process     Go to the Synchronize Advisee Information window     Select appropriate options  Choose the “Y” value for the Automatically update Advising from Registration configuration item     Select the Advising Configuration window     Enter “Y” to Automatically update Advising from Registration  Using Advising Groups  You can identify a group of advisors and then assign the group to students through a manual or batch process in both Advising and Registration.  The advising group will be displayed with the primary advisor and then ranked in the order by which you have identified them within the group. This will allow students to quickly see the name of their primary advisor as well as any other advisors within their group in the proper sequential order.  Before you can begin to use the Advising Groups functionality, you will need to configure it to meet your specific needs. The configuration is critical – here you can determine the tables that will be updated and synchronized in Registration, Advising, or both every time a group is assigned to one or more students.  Go to the   Advising Groups Configuration   window EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  57     Enter the advising year and term     When the   Use Entrance Year/Term for new advisees   checkbox is selected, the entrance year/term from the Student Master table is used for the update – if not available, the Advising Year and Advising Term will be used     To utilize this functionality, select the   Use Advising Groups   checkbox which will enable all  other options     If you want to prevent the Advising Group from being edited on the   Student Division   tab of the   Student Information   window in Registration, select the   Make Student division Advisors view only   checkbox     You can choose to utilize the Advising Groups functionality in Registration, Advising or both  o   If you choose the   RE   radio button, only advisors on the Student Division Master and Student Term Summary Division tables will be updated during the Advising Group Synchronization process  o   If you choose the   AV   radio button, only Advising module tables will be updated during the Advising Group Synchronization process     When Allow Filter is selected, you can identify specific columns to be used for filtering the groups when assigning the groups manually     If you plan to use the automated synchronization process, you will need to select one or  more Entrance Terms and/or Active Terms     The dates selected will be utilized by the automatic synchronization process     After selecting the   Allow Filter   checkbox, you can identify specific columns by which the  groups can be filtered – only values from these columns will be available when manually assigning Advising Groups  o   This can be extremely helpful since the filter will determine the Advising Groups displayed on the   Assign Advising Groups   window and will eliminate the need to scroll through non-relevant groups EX Advising Learning Guide   58  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Chapter 7.   U NDERSTANDING THE   P ROCESSES  This chapter will explain the important processes within the Advising module that will have a major impact on advisees – specifically, the ability for a student to meet their requirements and successfully complete their program(s) of study.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Create student aims     Apply alterations to one or more students     Compute a student’s progress and understand the process that occurs during this action     Remove a student progress lock     Use attributes to track sensitive details on a student     Create Advising groups  S UMMARY  In order for these objectives to be reached, you will need to ask the following questions, which are basically the premise of the Advising module:     How are student aims tracked?     Where and how are alterations performed?     How can a student’s progress be viewed?  Let’s examine some process that will answer these types of questions.  Student Aims  As mentioned earlier, once an aim is assigned to a student, it becomes a student aim. We have already reviewed the methods for using specific naming conventions and theories to support these aims as well as how they are configured within the software. Now, we will examine the location where you can quickly and easily view all of the aims that have been assigned to one student and determine their progress towards reaching these aims.  1   From the   Maintain Advisees   window, select a student and right-click to view available options  2   Select the   Maintain Student Aims   option  You will now be able to view all of the aims that have been assigned to the student. The information that is displayed on the right side of this window is in direct relation to the aim that has been selected on the left side of the window. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  59  3   The   Add Aim   and   Delete Aim   buttons are available on the upper right of the window  4   Click on the   Student Progress   button to compute the student’s progress and view the requirements for the aim (including the parent/child relationships)  It is important to remember that everything will be cleared out the existing tables when the Synchronize Advisee Information process is performed. Therefore, you will need to be able to recreate this information through the Degree Aim Cross Reference feature.  If you utilize the approval track feature, and alterations have not yet been approved, a message will be displayed in the Met section of this window indicating that unapproved alterations exist for the aim. EX Advising Learning Guide   60  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Performing Alterations  There are many situations where alterations will need to be taken into consideration for specific students.  Course substitutions and waived requirements are entered for a specific student, for a specific aim, through the   Student Progress   window.  1   Select an aim on the   Maintain Student Aims   window  2   Click on the   Student Progress   button for the selected aim  3   When the   Student Progress   window appears, highlight the course for which the alteration needs to be performed  4   Click on the   Alteration   button EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  61  Now you will be able to utilize the Met By Types that were defined earlier during the configuration and identify how the student will be able to meet the requirement  5   Click the   OK   button when the alteration has been identified  After an alteration has been added for a student, you also need to perform the compute student progress process in order for the override or course substitution to be applied to the student’s aim.  Compute Student Progress  The Compute Student Progress process is an automated feature that will update students whose records require recalculation due to changes in programs or registration. You can set the frequency of the process from the bottom section of the   Advising Configuration   window for 1 to 5 minute intervals. EX Advising Learning Guide   62  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You can also run a manual recalculation from the   Compute Student Progress   window.  You can determine the status of a student as it relates to their course needs and the process can be run for one student, a group of students, or all students.  The process loads the courses in the specific order in which they were taken by the student based on the Year Definition sort order, Term Definition sort order and Student Course History student sequence number.  When a student’s progress is computed, the student course history is compared with the student’s aims. Every advising requirement code that has not been forgiven will be used towards determining the student’s progress.  The following must be in place in order to print a Degree Audit or an Advising Worksheet:     You must have at least one active aim (look at the active/inactive status on an aim for a student)     You must have at least one advisor assigned to a student – if not, the report will not run  If you are unable to generate a degree audit for a student, you may want to look at these items and make sure they have occurred.  Once your academic recalc is performed, the student course history is updated and you are ready to compute student progress. By choosing the proper configurations and performing the correct sequence of steps, you will have a cleaner and more organized system. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  63  To select ALL students in the Advisee Master...  1   Choose either the   Student Progress   or   Course Needs   checkbox from the lower right of the window in the Rebuild section  2   Click the   OK   button  3   Depending on the checkbox that was selected, the student progress or course needs or both will be calculated for all students – by looking at the bottom left of the window, you will be able to see the actual updates that are being performed  If any errors occur during this process, a message will be displayed providing you with an error log number. Access the Application Log File window from the Tools menu option and locate this number to view the errors.  To select a group of students...  1   You may choose one of the following options:  o   Enter an advisor ID number and click on the   Retrieve   button to see all students assigned to that advisor.  o   Enter a requirement and click on the   Retrieve   button to see all students associated with that requirement.  o   Enter a year and click on the   Retrieve   button to see all students for the selected year.  2   Click the   Move to Selected   button to copy students to the Selected area  Only those names that appear in the Selected area will be included when the student progress or course needs is computed.  3   Choose either the   Student Progress   or   Course Needs   checkbox or both from the lower right of the window in the Rebuild section  4   Click the   OK   button  To select an individual student...  1   Enter a specific student ID number and click on the   Retrieve   button  2   Click the   Move to Selected   button to copy the student to the Selected area  You still need to move the student to the selected area to include the student in the process.  3   Choose either the   Student Progress   or   Course Needs   checkbox or both from the lower right of the window in the Rebuild section  4   Click the   OK   button EX Advising Learning Guide   64  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  What happens during this process?  Once the   OK   button is clicked, the following actions occur:     the current student progress log is cleared     the requirements are evaluated for each aim that has been identified for the student     the student’s coursework is read from the Registration Student Course History table     both the parent requirements as well as the summary information is updated to reflect the student’s current progress  As you can see, this is a very encompassing process which is the reason we recommend that you run the Registration Academic Recalc and the Advising Compute Student Progress simultaneously when needing to update the student’s Advising progress.  Regarding errors...whenever a major process is performed and several tables are updated, the system will notify you when errors have occurred within the process. In this case, you will have the ability to view these errors by accessing the application logs that are created and made available to you.  The   Application Log   tracks every process that is run in the Advising module and shows whether the process was a success or a failure. If a failure occurred, you will be able to view the error report and see where the actual error was encountered that caused the process to fail.  You can sort the log by date, process, status, ID number, or user name by clicking on the respective column header. While you may not want to spend a lot of your time looking at the application log file, you may find this very useful to troubleshoot problems that occur on a frequent basis. You will also be able to view the name of the person who performed the action, which may also be helpful information.  If a user is accessing the tree table and closes the table, the Mark Students for Rebuild action is performed and will be displayed on this application log file as such.  1   From the Tools menu, click on   Review Application Logs  2   Locate the necessary row  3   Click on the  View   button EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  65  Student Progress Locks  In order to prevent more than one person from updating a student’s aim or performing an update to the student progress, the Advising module prevents the same process from being performed by more than one person at the same time.  A student progress lock can be created for any of the following situations:     When the   Maintain Student Aims   window is opened     When the Rebuild Student Progress function is performed     When the Rebuild Course Needs function is performed  The lock is activated as soon as one of the above-mentioned situations occurs and the lock is removed when the process is complete. However, there may be occasions when the lock is not removed – such as when the process is not successfully completed. This may create an error message indicating that the table has been locked.  To manually remove a lock...  1   Go to the   Student Progress Locks   window  2   Select one or more rows to be deleted  3   Click the   Delete Row   button  4   Click the   Refresh   button  You may want to check this window on a daily basis and remove any locks that may have been created.  Attributes  At one time, Attributes were utilized exclusively by the Admissions and Development departments. However, there are ways that you can also use the Attributes feature to track existing health conditions, sensitive issues, private information, etc.  Some states have laws that require a written consent from students before you can update their academic record. In other words, you may not be able to change a student’s name after they have graduated unless you have received written consent to do so. This is where you can use the Attributes feature. EX Advising Learning Guide   66  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You can also track miscellaneous items such as a Dean’s hold – you may receive sensitive information from the Dean indicating that a certain student cannot register for classes – and the details can only be viewed by certain individuals. This is another scenario where the Attributes feature can be utilized.  In order to utilize this feature, there are four steps that need to be taken:  1   Define an attribute type  2   Create an attribute  3   Assign access  4   Choose attribute for student  To define an attribute type...  1   Open the   Attribute Definitions   window  2   Right-click on Attribute Type column and select   Maintenance Screen...  3   Right-click and select   Add Row EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  67  4   Enter an Attribute Type and a Description  5   Continue to add as many types as you need  6   Click the   Save   icon  It is important to remember that any Attribute that does not have an associated Attribute Type will be visible to everybody in the system.  Now that you have defined your Attribute Types, you can create your Attributes.  To create an attribute...  1   Open the   Attribute Definitions   window  2   Right-click and select   Add Row  3   Enter an Attribute Code and a Description  4   Using the drop-down menu from   Attribute Type , select the type to be associated with the Attribute  5   Continue to add as many attributes as you need  6   Click the   Save   icon  Now you have created your attributes and associated them with the appropriate type. This is important because you will be able to modify the attribute description after it has been assigned to a student but the attribute type will remain the same. This will allow you to create InfoMaker reports and choose all students who have been associated with a specific type. EX Advising Learning Guide   68  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  To assign access....  1   Go to the   Attribute User Access   window  2   Select a group from the drop-down menu  o   All of the Attribute Types that have been created will be displayed on the left side of this window  3   Highlight the Attribute Types for which access needs to be assigned and click on the  Add   button to move one or more from the Available Attribute Type on the left to the Selected Attribute Type on the right  Any Attribute that is not associated with an Attribute Type will be visible to everybody in the system, whether or not you have assigned access.  Since every report adheres to Attribute access, this feature is well secured within the software. You may even want to limit accessibility through InfoMaker – in that case, you can request that your database department create views that will also adhere to this same level of access. Then even your InfoMaker users will be prevented from viewing certain information that has been associated with an attribute for a student. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  69  To choose an attribute for a student...  1   Open the   Name Entity   window  2   Enter a student ID number  3   Click on the   Attributes   tab  4   Right-click to select   Add Row   and select an Attribute for the student  5   Click the   Save   icon  As illustrated in the screen capture above, you can select the same Attribute for a student and change the individual description to fit your needs. This particular scenario shows that an Attribute was assigned to the student on a specific date. The second time this Attribute was assigned to the student, the description was changed to reflect a different status.  This is the only place in the system where you can save the same code (in this case, an Attribute) with different information provided in the description.  Advising Groups  The relationship between an advisor and an advisee is a critical component during a student's matriculation.  If you are unable to generate a degree audit for a student, you may want to look at these items and make sure they have occurred.  By performing four basic steps, you can create one or more groups of advisors and seamlessly assign these groups to one or more students – the illustration below provides an overview of these steps. EX Advising Learning Guide   70  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You can only assign students to one group at a time.  It is important to keep the information synchronized so that students will always be aware of the advisors to which they have been assigned. Therefore, whenever any of the following events occur, the Advising History table will be updated accordingly during the synchronization process:     When a new relationship is created or removed between an advisor and an advisee     When the year or term is updated on an existing record     When a primary Advisor or Advisor type is modified  As you can see, the Advising Groups feature is very effective in assigning more than one advisor to a student.  When accessing this information on the   Student Information   window in Registration, you will not be able to deactivate any advisor belonging to an Advising Group since the synchronization process is responsible for updating the advisor assignment.  You can add an individual advisor to a student who has already been assigned to an advising group by adding an individual row on the   Student Division   tab of the   Student Information   window – and you can also deactivate this individual advisor from the   Student Information   window.  If you add an individual advisor on the Advising tab of the Student Information window, these changes will not be reflected on the Student Division tab.  After the proper configuration has been performed for this functionality (see page   56 ), you can begin to build and define your Advising groups. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  71  Creating Advising Groups  1   Go to the   Maintain Advising Groups   window  2   Right-click and select   Add Advising Group  Notice the icon   that appears next to the new group – this indicates that the Primary Advisor has not yet been identified and you will not be able to proceed until that has been done.  3   Right-click on the MUSIC group from the tree view on the left and select   Add Advisor  4   Select the   Advisor ID , select the   Primary Advisor type , and assign Advisor Number 1 EX Advising Learning Guide   72  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Now you can continue to add other advisors to this group.  5   Right-click on the MUSIC group from the tree view on the left and select   Add Advisor  6   Continue choosing advisors and remember to assign the appropriate Advisor number which will define the sequential order in which the advisors are displayed to students EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  73  Assigning Advisees to Advisor Groups  1   Click the   Assign Advisees   tab from the   Maintain Advising Groups   window (or access this directly from the   Assign Students to Advising Groups   window  2   Choose the Advising group for which students will be assigned  o   Continuing with the example provided earlier, we will select the MUSIC group  Notice that the Primary Advisor selected earlier is displayed in the Group Advisors section. If other advisors had been selected, they would also be displayed here.  3   After selecting the   Update Stud Term Sum Div   checkbox, click the   ...   button and choose the terms that will be updated  You will not want to override any data that may have been updated during the last academic recalc process or choose a term that has already passed.  4   When choosing the   Create Advisee Record   checkbox, new records will be created in the Advisee Master table for those students who do not yet have an existing record in Advising  5   After clicking the   Assign   button, all of the students that have been selected will be assigned to the MUSIC Advising group.   Also, if you make changes to an existing group, you will also be able to apply the changes to all students who were already assigned to the group. EX Advising Learning Guide   74  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  On the bottom left of this window, you will notice the   Remove Advisees   sub-tab. This tab is used to deactivate or delete advisor-advisee relationships within the selected group.  The Active and Inactive radio buttons determine the advisees retrieved for the specific group.  Deactivating relationships will set the advisor status to inactive in the Advisor Student table and the Advising History table. Deleting relationships will delete the row from the Advisor Student table and set the advisor status to inactive in the Advising History table.  The   Reports   tab will allow you to run any of the designated reports or customize them to fit your needs.  Specifically, when choosing the   r-adv_grp_synch_edit   report, you will be able to then select a date and see the last synchronization along with errors that may require troubleshooting. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  75  Synchronizing Advising Groups  The Synchronize Advising Groups process will:     create new relationships     deactivate or delete inactive relationships     update the Advising History table with any changes  Based on values selected on the Synchronize Advising Groups window and the Advising Groups Configuration window, records in any of the following tables may have their advisor information updated or synchronized:     Student Division Master     Student Term Summary By Division     Advisor Student Table     Advising History  Go to the   Synchronize Advising Groups  window.  Notice the two radio buttons in the Inactive Advisees Attributes section.  You may want to select the   Deactivate Relationships   option for students who were active in a previous semester. For example, if a student was enrolled in the Spring 2010 semester and is no longer enrolled in the Fall 2010 semester, the student will not have been chosen by any of the queries or active terms – therefore, you will want the synchronization process to inactivate the student in both the Advisor Student and Advising History tables.  On the other hand, if you choose the   Delete Relationships   option, the student will be removed from the Advisor Student table but will remain in the Advising History table.  You may choose to synchronize data on a manual basis or use the Process Schedule feature.  If the Schedule button does not appear on the Synchronize Advising Groups window, either the Client Application Services has not been installed on your machine or you do not have access to this process.  The query identified on the   Advising Groups  tab of the   Maintain Advising Groups   window (as illustrated to the left) will be used during this synchronization. EX Advising Learning Guide   76  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  The process will select records based on the Entrance Terms, Active Terms, or both identified on the   Advising Groups Configuration   window  The dates identified on the Advising Groups Configuration window will be used to determine the timeframe for which the Entrance and Active Terms are valid.  If the end date identified on the Advising Groups Configuration has passed, you will not be able to perform any type of synchronization. Therefore, you will need to return to the Advising Groups Configuration window and change the date in order to proceed.  The query associated with the group will be executed and students that need to be assigned to the Advising group will be identified.     If the student is not selected by the query, the student will become inactive for that group relationship since a new advisor-advisee relationship may have been established.     If the student is no longer enrolled, the student relationship will be inactivated or deleted according to the radio button you have chosen on this window.

U SING THE   R EPORTS  This chapter will introduce a variety of reports that can be used to extract specific information from the system.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand the functionality behind each of the available reports within the software  T YPES OF   R EPORTS  All of the reports can be accessed from the default Activity Center titled Reports - Advising.  Graduation Report  A student’s requirements, the courses that have been taken in order to satisfy each requirement and grades are displayed on the Graduation Report – that is, a student’s progress towards meeting their graduation requirements.  Student Course Needs Report  Course requirements that have not yet been met by the student will be displayed on this report. However, if you need to provide a printed version of this information to students, we recommend that you use the Student Course Needs Letter rather than this report since it is more flexible.  Student Course Needs Letter  You can create a letter that can be sent to each student indicating the specific course and group requirements that must be taken to fulfill their degree requirements for graduation.  The data that is displayed in this letter will reflect the status of the entire ancestry of AND relationships.  You may want to consider sending this letter to students when preparing for a new semester so the student will be made aware of each course that actually must be taken.  By utilizing the PDF 995 printer driver, you will have the ability to email this letter to your students.  Before generating this letter, be sure that you have selected the Course Needs  checkbox on the Compute Student Progress window to make sure that the student’s information is accurate. EX Advising Learning Guide   78  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Course Needs Analysis Report  This report shows what each student needs, by ARC, and whether the course is a requirement or optional. You can also sort the data to determine the number of seniors that will need to take a certain course before they are able to graduate – this type of information is very helpful with your course builder.  Non-Required Course Warning Letter  You can send a letter to students who have registered for courses that are not required for their degree; however, this will include free electives. Unless your institution is a lock-step program with no electives, this letter may not be appropriate.  Student Next Advising Date Report  You can use this report to display a list of all students along with their next schedule advisor meeting. If you are using Web tools, this information is easily accessible rather than using this report.  Retention/Graduation Report  If you are utilizing cohort codes from Registration, this report will allow you to view the status of a group of students who belong to the same cohort. The data regarding this cohort group can be viewed over a period of several years on this report.  If you are not using the IPEDS feature in Registration or if you have not established cohorts, this report will not produce any results.  Institutional Requirements Report  This report can be used to create a printed version of your trees, which can be done in a batch mode for every tree that was ever built or any combination thereof.  Advisor Workload Report  All students assigned to a specific advisor along with their primary aim can be viewed on this report. Remember to select only active students so that the process runs more efficiently. This report can easily be sent to advisors.  Curriculum Impact Analysis Report  You can select a course and this report will indicate where the ARC resides in every single tree within your Advising structure. This report will be extremely useful if you are considering making a change to a course since you will be able to see where this change will impact your tree structure.  Additional Reports  You may want to create additional reports that fit your specific needs – if so, your custom reports will remain in this folder which is also password protected.

W ORKING WITH   Q UICK   Q UERY  This chapter will explain the Quick Query feature including the elements, creation, and generation of queries.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand the manner in which a query is created and generated     Build your own query  S UMMARY  Quick Query allows you to extract information from the database by using select statements to identify the tables and columns containing the required data.  The four basic elements (Type, Profile, Definition, and Query) can be defined on the   Maintain Quick Query  window by selecting the appropriate data attributes, identify the user groups who can access the query, and create the conditions that need to be met by the query.  Considering the control that is available, we recommend that only your IT staff and power users be given access to this window.  You can select a definition and associated query to be generated against your database on the   Run Quick Query   window.  If the proper permission has been granted, new queries may also be created. EX Advising Learning Guide   80  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Understanding the Elements  As the screen capture above shows, the   Maintain Quick Query   window displays all four of the elements used for this process.  Type – identifies all of the tables and views that can be used  Delivered as default data through our Default Database Update tool, you cannot edit, remove, or add any Types due to the fact that key attributes have been defined linking the query results and the process. Any tables that can possibly be used for any of the queries that might be created beneath the Type will be identified and made available.  Profile – identifies targeted tables  You can target a smaller set of queries by using Profiles. For example, the Type might include tables from the Registration, Advising, and Student Life modules. You can then create a Course Authorization Profile that includes only those tables from the Registration module that are utilized for course authorization. While some Profiles are delivered though the Default Database Update tool and should not be changed, you also have the option to create your own Profiles.  Definition – identifies attributes that can be used for the selection criteria  Continuing to drill down into the elements, a Definition allows you to utilize operators, assign default values, and prompts that will be displayed though the query.  Query – identifies the statement used to select data  Finally, the Query is used to select the smallest sub-set of data from the Type, Profile, and Definition combination and to define the values, output, and sort order that will be chosen through the select statement.  By looking at the tree view from the   Maintain Quick Query   window, you will easily see the visual hierarchy represented by each of these elements.  The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are used to identify the Type, Profile, and Definition elements respectively. EX Advising Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g   & De v el o pm e nt  81  Building a Query  Below is an example of how you might build these elements to extract the specific information you need.  From the   Run Quick Query   window, right-click and select the   Add Query   option  In the details section of the   Run Quick Query   window, you will be able to define the query as illustrated below EX Advising Learning Guide   82  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Notice the Retrieve Query As section of the window along with the three radio buttons:     The query results will be displayed immediately if you select   New Results     If results from a previous query are already displayed, the   Filter Previous   option will use the filter from the new query     You can display the current query results along with the previous query by selecting the   Append to Previous   option  Click the   Output Def   tab to view the columns from the query, edit the headers, and change the display order of information",
