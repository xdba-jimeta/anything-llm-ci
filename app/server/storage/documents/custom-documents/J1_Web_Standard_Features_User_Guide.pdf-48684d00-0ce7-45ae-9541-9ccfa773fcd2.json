A tip is a trick or helpful hint that you   may not know, but could help make your daily job and  tasks easier and/or better.

Several things happen:  o   The syncing is removed  o   The list of Google calendars no longer appears  o   Any Google calendar events previously appearing on the Home page and Universal toolbar calendars no longer appear.  FAQ  Why can't I sync my Google and/or Outlook calendars?  If your school’s system administrator or campus support team has not activated calendar syncing (J1 Web System Administration, System Settings), this feature is unavailable.  Will other users be able to see my Google and/or Outlook calendar events and appointments?  No, your Google and/or Outlook calendar information only appears within your Calendar Center and on your Home page and Universal Toolbar calendars.  Why am I not seeing a Google calendar?  Only those Google calendars associated with the account used to log in are available to be selected. For example, Margaret Simpson has a professional Google account and a personal Google account. When Margaret sets up her Google sync, she uses her personal account credentials. She can only select her \"birthdays\" and \"personal appointments\" calendars and not the \"business meeting\" calendar associated with her professional Google calendar.  How do I remove a Google or Outlook calendar from my J1 Web calendar?  Simply deselect the checkbox of any calendar you no longer want to appear on your Home page calendar.  When I remove Google syncing, what happens to the Google calendar events that were appearing on my J1 Web calendar?  Once you click Remove syncing at Google, any and all Google calendar events, appointments, meetings, and scheduled time periods are immediately removed from your J1 Web Home page and Universal toolbar calendars.  What's the difference between deselecting a calendar and removing Google calendar syncing?  Deselecting a Google calendar removes only its related events, appointments, meetings, and scheduled time periods from J1 Web. If you have more than one Google calendar, those will still be available to appear in J1 Web. Removing Google calendar syncing eliminates any and all of your Google calendars and their related events, appointments, meetings, and scheduled time periods from J1 Web.
