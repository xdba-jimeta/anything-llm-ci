    "pageContent": "Advanced Charges and  Refunds Editing  Utilizing the Export to Excel and  Paste From Excel Features  Jim Rokusek and John Franklin  CampusWorks  December 20 , 2017 2  PURPOSE  By exporting the data from the Charge/Refunds tables, updating it in an Excel Spreadsheet and pasting  the data back into the Charge/Refunds tables, you can save a significant amount of time over keying  each detail entry individually. Charges with only a f ew lines of “Detail” are best updated manually.  However, charges such as course charges with dozens of lines are best updates by the copy - and - paste  method.  CampusWorks recommends that you practice this procedure in the Play Database prior to attempting  the same operations within the production database.  WORK INSTRUCTIONS  1)   Enter the Charges Table. Select a Charge and click on the “Detail” tab and then click on the  “Export to Excel” Button in the lower - right - hand corner.   See Figure 1.  Figure 1   –   The Charges Detail window.  Excel will automatically open with the Charge table data and will appear in the Taskbar in the lower area  of your computer screen. The data from the table will be displayed. See Figure 2. 3  Figure 2   –   The Excel Worksheet exported from the Charges table.  2)   You may copy and update this data within the Excel worksheet to create “new” rows of Charge  data. Some basic rules for working with this data:  -   This method does not allow you to bulk edit existing rows. You cannot edit rows and paste  them back into Jenzabar. You can only add new rows back into Jenzabar.  -   Do not add or delete columns .   You will need to copy every column back into the Jenzabar tables  so deleting columns will defeat your purpose.  -   Copy rows within the worksheet and paste them below the existing rows prior to editing.  -   Do not sort the rows once you have started editing   as you will lose track of which rows are new  and which are existing.  -   The   Year and Term columns must be identical to those in the database . If you need a sample,  you should enter a single charge row within Jenzabar EX prior to exporting the data to Excel.  This will provide you with a correct sample of how the data must be in order to paste back into  the Jenzabar window. See the above imag e, Row 2 and 3.  Once new Charges have been created, copy ONLY the data within the cells.  -   Do not copy the header row or any summary information.  -   Only copy the cells that contain the data needed to paste back into Jenzabar.  -   Do not copy entire rows, copy ranges of cells, i.e. columns “A” through “T” only.  -   Copy as many rows as desired but only columns “A” through “T” for each row.  Figure 3 shows a selection of cells that have been added to the worksheet and which are selected in  preparation for the Copy Function. Use the “Ctrl + C” key combination to copy these cells to the  Windows clipboard. 4  -  Figure 3   –   Cells added to the worksheet and selected for Copy to the Clipboard.  3)   Once you have copied the worksheet cells to the Windows Clipboard you are ready to paste the  data back into Jenzabar. The “Paste From Excel” button will only appear if have data on the  clipboard (copied from Excel). See Figure 4.  Figure 4   –   The “Paste From Excel” button is active. 5  4)   On the lower half of the   charges details screen, right - click your mouse to activate the popup  menu. You will need to select the “Add Row” menu item to add a new row to the database.   Do  not select “Insert Row” or you may overwrite existing data during the Paste operation. See  Figure 5.  Figure 5   –   The Popup Menu, Add Row item.  5)   Place your cursor in the “Year” field of the newly added record. See Figure 6.  6)   Click the “Paste From Excel” button to paste the data from the clipboard. See Figure 6.  Figure 6   –   The “Year” field and the “Paste From Excel” button. 6  Wait for the rows to be added to the table.  7)   Verify your data is correct. If the data appears to be correct, you may click the “Save” button to  save your work. If it looks like something went wrong you should close the window without  saving and go back to step 3.
