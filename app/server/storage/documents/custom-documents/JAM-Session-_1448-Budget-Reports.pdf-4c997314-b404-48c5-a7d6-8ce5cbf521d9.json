June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Karen Jones  Union Institute & University  Friday, June 3 – 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm  #1448   Budget Reports © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Budget Reports – So What?  3 important reasons to build Budget Reports     #1 – Being a “Tool provider” beats being an enabler!     #2 – More information available through Infomaker     #3 – Circumvents that pesky GL Account Security issue © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  What tools do I need to get started?  •   #1 – An understanding of Infomaker (or a really nice and friendly IT staff member who can turn your query into a report in exchange for some homemade cookies)  •   #2 – Ability to place Budget Reports on a user’s dashboard  (see #1 if you do not have access)  •   #3 – A list of budget reports you are asked to provide time and time again © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Example – Budget Report for a Pooled Account  •   At UI&U, our Advertising account is pooled (controlled by the VP for Enrollment Management).  •   Enrollment Directors located at each of our regional student service centers are allocated a portion of the pooled Advertising account for recruitment efforts.  •   The Advertising pooled account is:  01-000-0330-6265-0000   (3   rd   component code of “0330” = Enrollment Mgmt)  Regional student service centers located in CA, FL & OH get a “piece” of this account:  01-000-0330-6265-0420   Los Angeles, CA  01-000-0330-6265-0450   Sacramento, CA  01-000-0330-6265-0410   Cincinnati, OH  01-000-0330-6265-0440   Miami, FL © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Since general ledger account security is based on CC #3 and CC #4 – how to grant access to Enrollment Directors to a pooled account?
