First Publication Date: 01/18/2016  PURPOSE  This work instruction covers the basic method to Synchronize Advisee Information using the Synchronize  Advisee Information window in Jenzabar.  PRECONDITIONS  The user must have a Jenzabar account.  The user must have Admin access to the Advising module.  The user must have permission to utilize “Maintain Advisees”, “Maintain Student AIMS”, and the  “Synchronize Advisee Information” windows in Jenzabar.  If you are missing any of these permissions, you will be unable to perform these tasks. If that is the case,  contact your Jenzabar Security Administrator to request the appropriate permissions.  THE MAINTAIN ADVISEES   AND MAINTAIN STUDENT AIMS   SCREEN S  Open the Maintain Advisees Screen. You will be reviewing the AIMS assigned to the student. Enter the  ID Number and click on the “Find Now” button. The student record will appear in the list of available  advisees.  Right - click on the student record. Select “Maintain Student AIMS” from the popup menu. The  “Maintain Student AIMS” window will appear. From the “Maintain Student AIMS” window you will see all of the advising AIMS assigned to a student.  In this case, no AIMS have been assigned to this student. THE SYNCHRONIZE ADVISEE INFORMATION SCREEN  Open the “Synchronize Advisee Information” Screen. In the “query” selection drop - down find and select  the “q_sync_advisee_info_any_wo_aims” query.   This query selects students who do not yet have AIMS  assigned to them. The actual query is shown below for reference purposes.  SELECT   distinct  name_master . ID_NUM  from  name_master  JOIN   degree_history dh   ON   dh . id_num   =   name_master . id_Num  LEFT   OUTER   JOIN   stud_aims sa   ON   sa . id_num   =   dh . ID_NUM  WHERE  dh . adv_tree_yr_cde   >   =   2015   and  sa . id_num   is   null Go to the “Options” tab and select the following options by checking the boxes...  Click the “OK” button to start the process. Wait until the process finishes. At the end of this process, all  students that were lacking AIMS assignments who also had a valid degree and major assigned, will have  the correct set of AIMS assigned to them.
