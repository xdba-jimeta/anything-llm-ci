First   and foremost, we will   review findings from   the IPEDS  targeted functional assessment   conducted by CampusWorks ,   Inc. on behalf of Roxbury Community  College. Second, to enumerate remedial actions   already completed   as a result of   these findings. Third,  to detail outstanding issues which may require additional remediation activities   both near term and long  term .   And fourth, to explore Roxbury’s options for ensuring   data governance   sustainability into the  future.  INTRODUCTION  This targeted functional assessment   (TFA)   was requested by Roxbury ’s   leadership   team as a follow - on to  the NSC reporting TFA. Goals   and desired   outcomes   for this project are similar to that of the NSC  reporting TFA:  -   Ability to fully leverage Jenzabar in a   repeatable fashion to perform the standard business  processes required for IPEDS reporting.  -   Leverage tools and processes native to the commercial - off - the - shelf   (COTS)   systems licensed for  use by RCC (Jenzabar EX, PowerFAIDS) in preference over non - scalabl e, legacy custom solutions.  -   Identify the multiple functional areas   and business processes   that   effect RCC’s IPEDS reporting  capability.  -   Communicate findings and   recommendations to   enhance RCC’s IPEDS reporting capabilities.  -   Assess institutional readiness   for   required   business process re - engineering .  APPROACH  IPEDS reporting is dependent on student information collected over extended periods of time   (9+ years) ,  by   myriad   individuals   and   ever - changing   processes . While   current   business processes may be effec tive  today, we cannot infer that legacy processes were equally effective .   Nor can we assume that future  processes will be effective if we do nothing to ensure that outcome.  G iven the   recent   state of   IPEDS reporting results at Roxbury, it is safe st   to assume that   all legacy  processes   were ineffective at some point in time for whatever reason.   Rather than dwell on the  specifics of past   mistakes , CampusWorks   believes it is more productive to focus on the here, the now  and the future.  This does not   mean we completely ignore   the   old mistakes   nor the impact they have on Roxbury today.  I t simply means we focus on correcting the   problems   and avoiding them in the future.   To that end,  CampusWorks is 100% focused on understanding   and communicating   the ste ps Roxbury must take to  get from where they are to where they need to be.  As stated in the introduction, Roxbury wishes to   fully leverage Jenzabar in a repeatable fashion to  perform the standard business processes required for IPEDS reporting. This provid es the context for  where Roxbury needs to be and informs us   in our assessment of   where Roxbury currently stands.   This 4  context was used   to perform the analysis and develop   recommendations contained   within   this  document.  THE JENZABAR EX REGU LATORY REPORTIN G TOOLS  Overview  The Jenzabar EX   Regulatory Reporting tools   have existed since October of 2010, and were available in EX  3.3.   [ Roxbury is now on EX 7.2 ] .   Like many of the advanced EX tools the Regulatory Reporting tools  require familiarity, experimentati on and practice to be utilized successfully. While they are   not  necessarily intuitive and simple, they do appear to be effective if utilized in a consistent fashion.  The specifics of utilization are unique to every institution. This is due to the natur e of the product’s  flexibility.   And flexibility is required of the product because no two organizations operate in exactly the  same manner.  Jenzabar EX provides   numerous options for data snapshot collection.   Some of these options are needed  to support th e various data snapshot requirements particular to each IPEDS report. Some of these  options exist to allow flexibility in specifying where the snapshot tool should look for particular data  elements. Again, this is necessary due to the variability of lega cy data collection practices throughout  the Jenzabar user community. Each of these options need to be understood within the context of the  institution’s   current and legacy   data collection practices.  The data snapshots are retained   within   the primary EX production database. Access to the snapshots is  controlled by way of standard user and group permissions mechanisms inherent to Jenzabar EX.  Furthermore, snapshots can be “locked” by the system in order to prevent inadvertent corruption o f  historical data. These features ensure snapshot security and durability. This is far superior to   Roxbury’s  legacy practice of extracting data   from the database and saving it   to the file s torage s ystem   where it can  be   lost,   modified,   or corrupted .  The r eports provided within Jenzabar EX conform to the NCES IPEDS reporting requirements. The  reports are divided into sections and are segmented precisely as required by NCES. The reports also  summarize and tally based on the required segmentation, and also   permit drill - down to the component  student records. A handful of these reports also include the ability to deliver the data to NCES  electronically.  The documentation provided by Jenzabar is thorough though not always easy to find. The Help Topics  contain ed in the online Help system provide an excellent overview of the features and functions of the  regulatory reporting tools and are the easiest to locate and utilize. Additional documentation can be  found in the form of PowerPoint presentations, White Pape rs provided by Jenzabar, and end - user  presentations from Jenzabar Annual Meetings. Lastly, there is a user forum to which anyone may  subscribe. The forum provides access to questions posed by users and answers offered up by other  users and/or Jenzabar pr oduct specialists.  Overall, the regulatory reporting features of the Jenzabar EX system appear to be well - conceived,  adequate to the task, and fairly thorough. As with any tool, effort is required to learn the peculiarities of  the system and become profic ient in its use. Based on   CampusWorks’   first - hand experience utilizing 5  these tools, there appear to be no major flaws or defects that would prevent Roxbury from successfully  utilizing them to fulfill   many of   the IPEDS reporting obligations. Many other sc hools have successfully  implemented these features and appear to be satisfied with the results obtained.  Of course, the reports are only as good as the data behind them. No matter what approach is utilized  (commercial - off - the - shelf or custom), there are r igorous requirements for data quality that must be met  in order to achieve success in regulatory reporting.  Included  The off - the - shelf Regulatory Reporting tools in Jenzabar EX include reports for:  -   IPEDS Fall Enrollment  -   IPEDS 12 - Month Enrollment  -   IPEDS   Completions  -   IPEDS Outcome Measures  -   IPEDS Graduation Rates Surveys   -   100, 150 and 200 percent  Not Included  It does not provide reports for:  -   Commonwealth of Massachusetts HEIRS data submissions  -   IPEDS   Student Financial Aid   (Although Financial Aid data can be   captured within the Snapshots  and additional reports developed to fulfill this need.)  -   IPEDS Admissions reports  -   IPEDS Human Resources reports  -   IPEDS Finance reports  -   IPEDS Academic Library reports  Because Jenzabar does not provide coverage for 100% of the IPE DS reporting requirements, all  institutions must   develop a process for   address ing   these on their own .  Jenzabar does provide State Reporting   for   a limited number of states. However, Massachusetts is not  one of   them . Currently Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansa s state reports are available through Jenzabar. It  is possible that state reporting for Massachusetts might be available in the future, but that would likely  require a consortium of institutions approaching Jenzabar to fund that type of development work.  Required Data and Upstream processes  The Jenzabar EX regulatory reporting tools directly or indirectly depend upon 74 attributes contained  within the EX database. There are also numerous upstream processes that need to be faithfully  executed   so that the   data is ready for use in   regulatory reporting .  These dependencies can only be understood through in - depth study of the Jenzabar documentation,  familiarity with the tool sets and analysis of the results obtained. This knowledge is crucial in developing  repeatable, sustainable work process for producing the regulatory reporting products. 6  FINDINGS  The   74   IPEDS   Data Elements  Analysis of the 74 data elements was required in order to ascertain data readiness for use with the COTS  Jenzabar EX Regulatory Repor ting tools. Campus W orks performed a deep dive analysis of the  availability, consistency and completeness of these 74 attributes   going back to 2002, the year that  Roxbury first implemented the EX system .  As noted previously, IPEDS reporting is dependent   on student information collected over extended  periods of time   (9+ years) .   The data   must   be   complete and consisten t   in order to   produce   accurate  reports .  Our analysis uncover ed   the   classic   signs of long - term data governance absenteeism. This occurs whe n  an organization   operates on hopes and beliefs rather than facts.   CampusWorks determined that over  20 % of these   IPEDS   data elements   were unreliable and would require substantial rework prior to  utilization. CampusWorks also determined that these same da ta elements had been utilized in the  existing IR reporting workflows thereby raising significant question about the completeness and  accuracy of th e   prior   submissions.   Lastly, CampusWorks was not the first to recognize that these  problems existed at RCC.  Anecdotally, we know that prior attempts to establish data governance have been made. The   Data  Standards Committee   was established at some point, then was dissolved   and then reincarnated briefly  in April of 2018. No administrative - level leadership   team members   appear to have been involved . This  might explain why it ultimately   did not   gain a foothold.   There is   also   additional   evidence that data  governance may have   been attempted previously.   However, the overwhelming evidence   points to  absence of   data governance .  Remedial Data Scrubbing Required  From the analysis of the 74 IPEDS data elements,   CampusWorks determined that a substantial data  scrubbing effort   would be   required and immediately commenced with that effort   starting in late August  of 2018 .   CampusWorks has collaborated with   key   staff members ,   Cheryl Martin and Carrie Monestime,  to execute   the   data scrubbing tasks in order to remedy the deficiencies and prep are for future cycles of  IPEDS reporting.  The complete   laundry list of the 74 attributes is contained in a companion   workbook , titled “IPEDS  Reporting EX Data Sources Assessment” . Results of analysis and data scrubbing activities are   detailed  within th i s   workbook .   Tremendous progress has been made,   however   there are still outstanding items  requiring attention.  At this point in time, Roxbury’s student information has never been   more   complete   and   accurate as it is  today . CampusWorks and the Roxbury   team have taken steps to ensure it remains so   by developing,  implementing and utilizing a comprehensive set of data governance tools that identify issues proactively  so that staff members can correct them   in a timely fashion .  Some h ighlights of the data sc rubbing efforts include:  -   Properly aligning   student course history records to correct transcript divisions so that summary  tables and student transcript reports are now 100% accurate going back to 2002. 7  -   Assigning and propagating high school graduation dates   across (the multiple tables) where high  school graduation is recorded so that consistency and completeness is maintained in perpetuity.  -   Migration of all legacy Race and Ethnicity data   from the old Jenzabar schema (Biograph Master)  to the new Jenzabar sche ma (IPEDS Ethnic Race Report) so that this information is available to  the regulatory reporting tools.  -   Proper alignment of entry dates based on of the actual first year/term ever enrolled as an  undergraduate. Consistency, accuracy and completeness is   now   being   maintained in perpetuity.  -   Ensuring that the citizen of attribute correlates to an actual country code recognized by IPEDS.  -   Correctly aligning all class codes to student records within the Student Term Summary rollup  tables. Consistency, accuracy and   completeness is now being maintained in perpetuity.  Previously, flawed logic and sporadic execution of that logic had resulted in extreme inaccuracy  of this data.  Data Governance Tools  Jenzabar provide s   no   tools to support data governance efforts.   Ever y school must implement their own  data governance strategy and methods. There are also no third - party, plug - in s that come preconfigured  to operate on a Jenzabar EX database. All key performance indicators such as data quality and  consistency metrics must   be designed and implemented by individual organizations.  That being the case, CampusWorks has assisted RCC by developing   data governance   tools as needed.  The first set of data   quality,   completeness and consistency tools was developed and implemented   in  J une of 2017   for the NSC Reporting   targeted functional assessment. Ongoing use of these tools has  resulted in Roxbury maintaining close to 100% completeness and accuracy   for   critical NSC   reporting data  elements.  CampusWorks has   expanded on   this work and   has   provided   additional data governance   tools   specifically  designed to address   the   IPEDS data elements.   Simil ar,   positive results are   starting to be   achieved   with  the IPEDS data elements.  Legacy Institutional Research Processes  CampusWorks was unable to determine   the exact legacy processes employed to meet regulatory  reporting requirements.   No written documentation was made available to us. Therefore, we   have  anecdotal information only.  The standard procedure was initiated by   the Director of Institutional Research by requesting data  extracts/snapshots from the production   Jenzabar   EX database. These routine requests usually  correlated to key census dates. However, additional special requests were also received   on a frequent  b asis .  All data extracts were delivered to the   IR   Director as Excel spreadsheets. There is some evidence that  the legacy IR reporting process involved data analysis and data scrubbing   as the data was being utilized.  The tools, techniques and outcomes are   unknown. In general, any data scrubbing effort carried out on  derivative data (rather than master data) can be considered unfortunate, as with each new extraction of  the data, the scrubbing will need to be repeated. This process would appear to be ineffi cient and sub -  optimal. 8  CURRENT STATUS  The IPEDS Reporting project has proceeded slowly but has produced measurable improvements.  Significant data   quality issues have been remedied and a number of data   governance issues have been  corrected.   Critical IPE DS data elements are now being examined on a routine basis and are being  maintained to a very high level of consistency and completeness.  We have achieved our goal of leveraging tools and processes native to the COTS systems in order to  produce IPEDS regulatory reports.   To date, all 2018 IPEDS reports have been produced using snapshots  and reports native to the system.   These include:  -   IPEDS   Fall Enrollment  -   IPEDS Outcome Measures  -   IPEDS Graduation Rates Surveys   -   100, 150 and 200 percent  Even so, Roxbury continues to engage in manual data manipulation   and segmentation   as the final  submissions are prepared. CampusWorks has provided access to t he COTS tools and reports, however  the interim IR staffing resource has not yet adopted their use. Instead, requests for data extracts are  still the norm.   The   requested   data   extracts are being produced directly from the COTS IPEDS reports ,  the final   presentation layer of the toolset. This presentation layer produces properly segmented and  formatted information in conformance to the NCES submission requirements.  The additional steps being taken by   interim   staff are unnecessary and   have the potential   to introduce  error.   T he interim staff appear to have no mandate nor any interest in leveraging the tools and  processes native to the COTS system . This is remarkable considering   that the interim staff member  reports   directly to   one of Roxbury’s senior le aders .  At this time, there is no dedicated IR resource at Roxbury to which IPEDS reporting knowledge can be  transferred.   CampusWorks anticipates that the appointment of a full - time,   dedicated   IR resource will  mitigate some of these issues   and help bring t his project to closure.  OUTSTANDING ACTION I TEMS  Additional Data Scrubbing  While a significant amount of data scrubbing has already taken place, there are some notable tasks that  can be considered incomplete and require further discussion.  First Time in P ostsecondary, Transfer - In  This is a critical IPEDS student attribute. It is used in IPEDS report segmentation and rollups.   We have  still not determined a proper algorithm to address the issue of data collection for First Time in  Postsecondary or Transfer   In attributes. Far too many of the students are recorded as Neither.  However, this is clearly incorrect. Virtually all undergraduate students should be classified as First Time  in Postsecondary or Transfer - In at the time they first enroll at RCC. This   attribute is specific to the  Entrance Year and Term on the Student Division Master record. So technically, all should be marked as  either FT or TI. 9  Some rudimentary rules have been implemented during the 2018 IPEDS reporting cycle, but these can  only be   considered stop - gap measures as they are only implemented within the play database at this  time.   This requires further discussion and action.  Exit Date and Exit Reason  The Jenzabar EX regulatory reporting tools inspect the Exit Date and Exit reason attrib utes during the  processing of IPEDS Outcomes Measures reports. RCC does not systematically capture this data and  most non - returners   (56%)   have neither exit date nor exit reason. This has the potential to skew IPEDS  reports.  Further discussion and mitig ating efforts are required. RCC should consider business rules and standard  processes that may be required to capture and enter this data consistently. Automated data scrubbing  can also be considered though may not prove feasible.  Financial Aid Data  Jenzabar is capable of retrieving financial aid data and incorporating it into snapshots   and IPEDS reports.  However, legacy financial aid data would need to be examined carefully and thoroughly scrubbed in  order to get this operational. RCC has only just   begun to utilize the Jenzabar and PowerFAIDS financial  aid tools as an integrated system within the past   several years , so correcting errors and omissions which  occurred prior to   Spring 2015   may be required. We have already seen where missing POE informa tion  has impacted Jenzabar’s ability to retrieve financial aid data for the IPEDS Outcomes Measures report  delivered the second week of February.  Other Opportunities  There are also other less important data attributes that may merit data scrubbing. All ar e covered in  greater detail within the companion Excel workbook.  Additional   Opportunities for Improvement  Process Rigor  The most common   factor a ffecting   repeatability   and   sustainability   is lack of process rigor and adequate  documentation. This results   in   the “blank slate” effect. In the absence of business process  documentation and readily available work instructions, every regime change will be accompanied by  undesirable changes to existing business processes   due to   lack of   knowledge transfer .  The “bl ank slate” effect   was clearly visible within the legacy student data during our initial analysis of  the 74 IPEDS attributes going back to 2002. Various epochs and regimes could be clearly identified by  the peculiar absence/presence of attributes or the pe culiar misalignment of certain   rollup/summary  data . It was clear that each regime was   starting from scratch and   inventing standard procedures for  themselves , sometimes neglecting essential COTS processes that are required for   the system to operate  correct ly.  While this   can be   a fascinating study, it is not important to quantify or profile each regime   change.   Of  greater importance is   what we learn from these observations and how we   resolve   to   prevent th e  phenomenon   from   re curring in   the future. 10  Process   rigor is the best means of achieving repeatability and sustainability. Process rigor can be  developed at any time, presuming a willingness on the part of the contributors.   It is a team effort  requiring collaboration, documentation, annual review and appr opriate incremental revision.  Developing a culture where this type of engagement is routine takes time and energy . It requires strong  leadership and compelling incentives .   It will pay dividends if achieved.  Business Process Re - Engineering  No amount of b usiness process re - engineering can remedy a lack of business process rigor   or   a culture  where process rigor is undervalued .   Process rigor reinforced by superior documentation   could   be  considered   a pre - requisite to business process re - engineering.   Busines s process re - engineering will fail  in a culture where   process improvement, process documentation and outstanding results are not  celebrated openly ,   loudly   an d   frequently .  There are supporters of process rigor at Roxbury , i ndividuals who are willing to inve st and contribute at  a higher level.   But these individuals are not recognized, celebrated and rewarded as they should be.  The challenge for administration lies in learning how to recognize these individuals , provisioning them  with leadership roles ,   empow ering them to   lead   and celebrating their successes.  There are several examples of area/departmental leaders who engaged in transformational change, re -  engineered their processes and achieved outstanding results but were never recognized for their efforts.  T heir successes were never celebrated,   and   those around them   had   no   knowledge of their  achievement s .   These individuals adhered to the mandate to   l everage tools and processes native to the  commercial - off - the - shelf (COTS) systems   and successfully transfor med how they delivered services to  students . Yet it is unclear if anyone at Roxbury noticed.  Examples of this include the offices of Advising, Financial Aid and Enrollment /Registration .   At this time,  many of the re - engineered processes are at risk of bei ng lost , m ostly due to lack of awareness and  minimalizing   the achievements .   Regression is imminent. T he “blank slate” effect is   now   resurfacing  with alarming frequency.   That would not happen in a culture where process rigor is valued and  celebrated.  Cam pusWorks must conclude that Roxbury has not developed the prerequisite culture   required   to  succeed at business process re - engineering.  Staffing  Staffing at Roxbury   is frequently in a state of flux.   High turnover   poses significant challenges for  continui ty of operations. Repeatability and sustainability suffer. As noted previously, the “blank slate”  effect   prevails   in the absence of comprehensive business process documentation ,   detailed work  instructions , and deliberate onboarding regimens .  Mastery of Jenzabar EX   (any module)   and PowerFAIDS   requires focus, determination, collaboration and  hard work. These systems do not run themselves.   Mastery requires substantial investment from  individuals and the enterprise. Turnover   equates to   loss of   th ese   investments. 11  Considering the   investments made   to develop the competencies   needed to operate the   Jenzabar EX   and  PowerFAIDS   systems , Roxbury should consider development and retention of   experienced , productive  staff to be a top priority.",
