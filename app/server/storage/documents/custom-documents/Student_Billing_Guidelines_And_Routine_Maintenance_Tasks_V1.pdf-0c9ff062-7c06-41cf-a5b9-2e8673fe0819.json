This is not a fully automatic process, however with careful setup and maintenance the  vast majority of work will be   automated,   and the number of manual adjustments should be minimal.  Preconditions  -   Individuals who are tasked with maintaining the Hours/Charges/Refunds tables must be trained to  perform the functions required.  -   Individuals who are tasked with maintaining the Hours/Charges/Refunds tables should be well - versed  in the standard utilization of the tool sets. This type of familiarization can only be gained by practical  use of the tools. Practice should only occur wit hin the EX Play database.  -   I ndividuals(s) working with   Hours/Charges/Refunds   configurations need sufficient permissions to  modify, add and delete   hours,   charges   and   refunds, as necessary.  -   All charges must be approved by the Board of Trustees   prior to entering them   into Jenzabar .  -   The timeline   included   in this document must be followed   precisely. This will ensure   accurate student  billing   and will prevent the need for correcting accounts by way of   journal entries.  I NTRODUCTION  The Jenzabar EX Accounts Receivable Module is an extremely complex,   integrated system. However the  number of configuration options is not always adequate to meet the desired outcomes of RCC without  occasional manual interventions. The system is, however, rather robust and will function as expected when  configured and main tained correctly. It is extremely important to follow the instructions and the timeline  exactly as they are described in this document. Failure to configure a single data item may result in cascading  errors that are difficult to track and correct. The bi lling system is very unforgiving of even simple mistakes. If  the instructions are followed precisely, very few manual interventions or corrections should be necessary.  KEY   C ONCEPTS  -   Preliminary Charges are simply estimated charges. These charges are not permanent and can never be  posted to a student account.  -   Preliminary charges are used to inform students of their potential financial obligations. They are also  utilized by the Business Office to audit the charges automation setup prior to finalizing student charges  for a term.  -   All preliminary charges are automatically deleted each time a subsequent run of preliminary charges is  performed.  -   All preliminary charges are also automatically deleted when Actual Charges are run.  -   Refunds are never part of the Preliminary Charges runs. Refunds are unnecessary for preliminary  charges because there are no actual charges to offset.  -   The primary reason to refrain from running actual charges prematurely is to maintain simplicity of  account statements. If actual charges are run prior to the close of the add/drop period, excessive line 4  items will be present on a student’s statement. With actual charges, the system is required to adjust  debits and credits based on changes to a students’ enrollment. This creates excess line items that  require additional interpretive effort. It is better   to avoid this issue altogether by running actual  charges after the add/drop period closes. 5  DO’S   A ND   D ON’TS   O F   S TUDENT   B ILLING  ✓   Registrar: Never modify Course Components 1 or 2 after students have registered for class. Many of  the course specific charges utilize these two course components. Modifying them after registration  will corrupt the charges and refunds on the student acc ounts. It would be acceptable to modify  Course Component 3, if absolutely necessary.  Best Practice :   Finalize all course designations prior to allowing students to register for classes. Do not  modify Section Master course components after students have registered for a particular course.  ✓   Registrar:   Always use the “Withdraw” process when dropping students from courses after the census  date. This is the ONLY way to prevent the student from receiving a refund for the course. This feature  works with sub - terms and other “late start” courses in each term . While the system warns the user of  the condition, the end user ultimately controls how the drop is handled.  Best Practice : Always Withdraw students from courses if the drop date is after the census date for the  course. This will make it possible to enforce the no refund policy within the automated  Charges/Refunds process.  ✓   CCE and Registrar: For like courses having distinctly different fees, always utilize Course Component 2  in order to differentiate the courses adequately. This reduces the overhead required to maintain the  charges tables.  Best Practice : Try to avoid variability of course fees for like courses. Overly complex fee schedules are  difficult to build and maintain over   time.  ✓   CCE, Business Office,   and Registrar : Make use of the Student Billing data QC report tools available.  These tools allow RCC to proactively manage potential issues before they become serious problems.  Best Practice : The Student Billing data QC reports should be “clean” prior to running automated  charges. This will prevent the propagation of problems to student accounts and will reduce workload  for all stakeholders.  ✓   Business Office: Never modify the charges and refunds tables   after   they have been used to generate  actual   charges for a particular year/term. Doing so will require you to perform manual account  adjustments for the remainder of the term for any student processed before the modifications were  made. This is especially true of refunds.  Best Practice : Thoroughly QC review, test and “freeze” the hours, charges and refunds definitions prior  to utilization. All testing should occur in the Play database.  ✓   Business Office: Never modify A/R configuration settings once automated charges/refunds have been  executed for a specific term. Doing so introduces variables that cannot be tracked or traced.  Best Practice : If A/R Configuration changes are ever needed, know why you are changing them and  only change them between semesters. 6  ✓   Business Office:   Never utilize the “Override Refunds” percentage options that are available on the  “Student Charges” and “Term Group Control” windows. Current RCC refund policies and configuration  settings do not require this. In fact, use of this feature is simply not n ecessary. The automated  charges and refunds are setup with correct refund percentages so overrides will actually cause  significant issues.  Best Practice : Never use the “Override Refunds” feature.  ✓   Business Office:   Never consider the   Charges Results window (the “Print Preview” window that appears  after running Student Charges) as a full statement of the student’s account. It is not. The “Print  Preview” window only includes activity for the current batch. It does not include all tran sactions made  to a student’s account. Only the “A/R Inquiry” window can provide full details of a student’s account.  Best Practice :   When analyzing a student’s charges and refunds, always view the full statement of  account by way of the “A/R Inquiry” window. 7  AUTOMATED STUDENT BILLING   SETUP TASKS   -   CHECKLIST  The following tasks must be performed on a semester basis. These are preparatory tasks required to  maintain the automated charges configuration within Jenzabar. This checklist is an   overview of the  required tasks and indicates the recommended order of execution. Details about each task are provided  later in the details sections.  ✓   Copy Charges   and R efunds   from current semester to future semester.  ✓   Amend Hours ,   Charges   and   Refunds   tables to account for new course offerings.  ✓   Adjust charges and fees to conform to Board approved charges and fees schedules.  ✓   Pre - Billing Data Quality and Completeness reviews. Correction of non - conforming data inputs.  ✓   Configuring Term Group Controls to specify how charges will be generated to student accounts.  ✓   Configuring Subsidiary Controls for account statement generation.  COPY ING   CHARGES AND REFUNDS   E N   M ASSE   -   D ETAILS  In Jenzabar the Charges and Refunds tables contain charges and refunds definitions specific to each  semester. A distinct set of charges and refunds must exist for every year/term combination for which  the business office wishes to automate student charges . Therefore, Charges and Refunds must be  created each semester.  Currently, RCC utilizes 19 distinct fee codes in the Charges and Refunds tables. These fee codes are as  follows:  Code   Description  25   Radiology Course Fee  30   Course Fees II (1st Yr Enroll Fee)  AA   Registration fee  BB   Operation fee  CC   Day Tuition  EE   DCE Tuition  FF   Day Fees  HH   DCE Fees  I1   Health Insurance for Spring  II   Health Insurance  J1   Health Insurance Waiver Spring  JJ   Health Insurance Waiver  K1   Non - Credit Course  KR   Non - Credit Registration Fee  KR_W   NC Reg Fee Waiver 8  LB   Laboratory Fee  NP_SEM   Nursing Program Semester Fee  SA   Student Activity  TF   Technology Fee  Each of the fee codes contains specific details of   the attributes (student and course) that trigger the  charge to be applied to a student’s account. At this time, the Charge table contains over 250 distinct  attribute combinations that result in charges being applied to a student’s account. These charge t able  entries must be carried forward to each new semester. The Refund table entries must also be carried  forward to each new semester. All totaled, there are 498 charge and refund table entries that must be  carried forward in order to sustain the automat ed charges and refunds capability.  Maintaining the Charges and Refunds tables is a substantial task not to be taken lightly. Fortunately,  Jenzabar provides a tool to copy the charges and refunds from one semester to another. Even so, the  “Copy Charges/Refunds” tool must be utilized with c aution.  Assuming that the Charges and Refunds tables produced the desired results during the previous term, it  is reasonable to expect that the college would want to propagate the configuration to the next term.  The “Copy Charges/Refunds” tool is designed to perf orm this function. The following work instruction  walks you through the copying of Charges and Refunds. It is a relatively simple process.  1)   Locate the link to the “Copy Charges/Refunds” tool in Jenzabar. The tool is available in the  “Settings & Utilities   –   Student Billing” activity center. See Figure 1.  The “Copy Charges/Refunds” tool   does not replace   the charges or refunds for an entire  semester. It simply adds charges and refunds detail records into the tables. This will result in  duplicate charges/refunds table entries.  If an exact copy is desired, the target year/term must be cleared out prior to performing the copy  operation. There is no option available within the “Copy Charges/Refunds” tool to clear the target  semester prior to executing the copy operation. If your   target year/term already contains Charges or  Refunds entries of questionable origin, it is best to delete them prior to performing the copy  operation.  You may need to request assistance from your database administrator to   determine the origin of the  existing Charges and Refunds. You might also need to ask that the database administer clear out the  charges/refunds tables for a specific year/term combination since there is no native functionality that  permits end users to ac complish this task. 9  Figure 1   –   The “Copy Charges/Refunds” link.  2)   Open the “Copy Charges/Refunds” window by clicking on the link shown above. The “Copy  Charges/Refunds” window will open.  3)   Select the “Charges to Charges” copy criteria by clicking on the “Charges to Charges” radio  button. See Figure 2.  Figure 2   –   the “Charges to Charges” radio button.  Once the “Charges to Charges” radio button is selected, the “Details” radio button will  automatically be selected as well. These are the correct selections. See figure 3.  Figure 3   –   the “Charges to Charges” and “Details” radio buttons are selected.  4)   The window will now display “Source” and “Target” options. In the “Source” area, select the  “Year Code” and “Term Code” from which you wish to copy Charges. In this example, we have  selected Year Code = 2017 and Term Code = SP.   Once year and term are   selected, the list of  available Charges is populated. See Figure 4. 10  Figure 4   –   Source Year Code and Term Code are selected and available charges are displayed.  5)   Next, select the “Target” year and term. In this example, we have selected Year Code = 2017  and Term Code = SM as the target year and term. This means that the Charges from 2017 SP  will be copied to 2017 SM. See   F igure 5.  Figure 5   –   The “Target” year and term are now selected.  Pay careful attention to the list of Charges displayed in the Target area. If after selecting the  Target Year and Term there are no charges shown in the target list, this indicates that the  Charges tables for the “Target” year and term are empty. This is   the desired state. See Figure 5.  If there are Charges listed in the “Target” area it means that there are already charges  configured on the “Target” year and term. Normally, this is not the desired state. Please see 11  caution statement provided earlier in this document. See Figure 6 for example of undesirable  state.  Figure 6   –   A “Target” year and term which already have Charges in the tables.  This is undesirable in most circumstances.  6)   Next, select the Charges you wish to copy. Usually, you will want to select all charges except for  the “Health Insurance” and “Health Insurance Waivers” (Fee Codes II, I1, JJ, J1). These are the  only charges that will be copied separately from a differen t source year and term. Figure 7  shows the selected Charges and unselected Charges. [Hint: Select all charges by doing the  following: click on the first row of the source list then scroll down to the bottom of the list.  While holding the Shift Key, sele ct the last row. All rows will now be selected. Next, scroll  upwards to   find the “I” and “J “charges. Hold the Ctrl Key and click on each of the “I” and “J”  charges one by one in order to de - select them. The list should now appear as in Figure 7.] 12  Figure 7   –   The Charges selected for the copy process.  7)   Once the charges are selected, click the “Add” button to move them into the “Target” list. See  Figure 8. 13  Figure 8   –   The “Add” button.  Figure 9 shows the result of clicking the “Add” Button. The selected Charges have been   moved  into the “Target” list, leaving behind the “I” and “J” charges. 14  Figure 9   –   After clicking the “Add” button.  8)   At this point you are ready to execute the copy process. Click on the “OK” button to execute the  copy process. The “Copy Charges/Refunds” window will close all by itself when the copy process  is completed. You should have successfully copied charges fro m one year/term to another  year/term.  COPY ING   CHARGES AND REFUNDS   P IECEMEAL   -   D ETAILS  As demonstrated in the above work instructions, there are times when not all charges should be copied  from one year/term to another. In the above example, we did not copy the “I” and “J” fee codes  because the Summer term does not require a Health Insuranc e charge nor waiver.  If we had been copying charges from Fall to Spring we would still have left out the “I”   and   “J” fee codes  because Health Insurance charges for Fall and Spring are handled under separate fee codes. “II” and “JJ”  fee codes go with Fall terms and “I1” and “J1” fee codes go with Spring terms. In order to copy the  correct “I” and “J” charges for a   Fall term, the user must select a prior Fall term as the “Source” and the  upcoming new Fall term as the “Target”.  The steps are similar. In this next example we are copying the Health Insurance charge “II” and the  Health Insurance Waiver “JJ” from “Fall 2017” to “Fall 2018”.  1)   As before, select the “Charges to Charges” copy criteria by clicking on the “Charges to Charges”  radio button. See Figure 10. 15  Figure 10   –   the “Charges to Charges” radio button.  Once the “Charges to Charges” radio button is selected, the “Details” radio button will  automatically be selected as well. These are the correct selections. See figure 11.  Figure 11   –   the “Charges to Charges” and “Details” radio buttons are selected.  2)   The window will now display “Source” and “Target” options. In the “Source” area, select the  “Year Code” and “Term Code” from which you wish to copy Charges. In this example, we have  selected Year Code = 2017 and Term Code = FA.   Once year and term are   selected, the list of  available Charges is populated. See Figure 12.  Figure 12   –   Source Year Code and Term Code are selected and available charges are displayed.  3)   Next, select the “Target” year and term. In this example, we have   selected Year Code = 2018  and Term Code = FA as the target year and term. This means that the Charges from 2017 FA will  be copied to 2018 FA. See figure 13. 16  Figure 13   –   The “Target” year and term are now selected.  4)   Next, select the Charges you wish to copy. In this example we only wish to copy the “Health  Insurance” and “Health Insurance Waivers” (Fee Codes II, and JJ). Figure 14 shows the selected  Charges and unselected Charges. [Hint: Hold down the Ctrl Key an d select the II and JJ fee codes  one by one.   The list should now appear as in Figure 14.] 17  Figure 14   –   The II and JJ Charges selected for the copy process.  5)   Once the charges are selected, click the “Add” button to move them into the “Target” list.  Figure 15 shows the result of clicking the “Add” Button. The selected Charges have been moved  into the “Target” list. Only the II and JJ charges will be copied. 18  Figure 15   –   After clicking the “Add” button.  6)   At this point you are ready to execute the copy process. Click on the “OK” button to execute the  copy process. The “Copy Charges/Refunds” window will close all by itself when the copy process  is completed. You should have successfully copied the II and   JJ charges from one year/term to  another year/term.  M ODIFYING   THE II AND JJ   C HARGE   C ODES   F OR   T HE   N EW   TERM   -   D ETAILS  After the Health Insurance and Health Insurance Waiver fee codes are copied from one year to another,  the waiver needs to be modified slightly in order to function correctly for the new Year. In the above  example we   copied II and JJ fee codes from 2017 FA to 2018 FA. The charges details on the JJ fee code  need to be updated to reflect the 2018 year code in the Charge Element 1 position. This charge element  references the Biograph_Master.UDEF_5A_2 field and must be u pdated to the correct year.  1)   Locate the link to the “Charges” tool in Jenzabar. The tool is available in the “Settings & Utilities  –   Student Billing” activity center. See Figure 16.  Figure 16   –   Link to the “Charges” tool. 19  2)   Click on the “Charges” link to open the “Charges” tool in Jenzabar. The “Charges” window will  be displayed. See Figure 17.  Figure 17   –   The “Charges” window.  3)   Locate and select the “JJ” fee code in the Charges list. See Figure 18.  Figure 18   –   The JJ fee code is selected.  4)   Click on the Open button to open the “Charges Definition/Charges Details Entry” window. See  Figure 19. 20  Figure 19   –   The “Charges Definition/Charges Details Entry” window.  5)   Navigate to the “Detail” tab by clicking on the Detail tab. The charge details will be displayed.  See Figure 20.  Figure 20   –   The “Detail” tab of the “Charges Definition/Charges Details Entry” window.  6)   Now you should filter the details records by entering the Year and Term into the Filter drop -  downs (the Yellow colored   controls). Select “2018” for the Year and “FA” for the term. See  Figure 21. 21  Figure 21   –   The filter selections of 2018 FA.  7)   Now you must apply the filters using a   two - step   process. Right click on any of the Yellow  controls to activate the Pop - Up menu. Select “Search On All Columns” from the Pop - Up menu.  See Figure 22.  Figure 22   –   The “Search On All Columns” menu item.  Next, right click on any of the Yellow controls to activate the Pop - Up menu once again. Select  “Filter As Equal” item from the Pop - Up menu. See Figure 23.  Figure 23   –   The “Filter As Equal” menu item. 22  The details records will now be filtered to only display 2018 FA Health Insurance Waivers.  8)   There are only 2 details records in this fee code. Both require modification. You will need to  scroll down to see the second record. Highlight the Charge Element 1 value and change it from  2017 to 2018. See Figure 24.  Figure 24   –   The Charge Element 1 value that must be changed.  Now scroll down to the second record and change the value from 2017 to 2018.  9)   Save your changes by clicking on the “Save” button located at the top left corner of your  Jenzabar screen. See Figure 25.  Figure 25   –   The   “Save” button.  10)   Finally, do not forget to verify the Flat Fee associated with the Health Insurance charge and  Health Insurance Waiver are correct. These may have changed since the previous year. If the  Flat Fee amount has changed, you will need to update these same deta il records.  At this time the reader is likely realizing that the Hours, Charges and Refunds configuration in Jenzabar  is quite intricate. It is no small feat to establish a functioning configuration that accurately debits and  credits student accounts. Becoming a c ompetent owner/operator will require a substantial investment of  time and energy. Remember to take advantage of the Play database as you familiarize yourself with the use  of these toolsets. 23  N EW   C OURSE   O FFERINGS   -   D ETAILS  Many of the Hours, Charges and Refunds are setup to reference specific course offerings as triggers for  the automated hours counts, charges and refunds. When new course offerings are introduced there is a  high likelihood that the course will need to be ad ded to either an hours bucket or a charge/refund  details table.  Currently there are 2 Hours Buckets that reference specific courses:  Code   Description  08   Nursing Semester Charge  07_KR_W   NC Reg Fee Waiver for Kids  And there are 5   Charges/Refunds tables which reference specific courses:  Code   Description  25   Radiology Course Fee  30   Course Fees II (1st Yr Enroll Fee)  K1   Non - Credit Course  LB   Laboratory Fee  NP   Nursing Program Fee  At the time of this writing, there are 7 new course offerings for the 2018 Spring Semester. These  courses most likely need to be added to the Hours, Charges and Refunds tables for the 2018 Spring  Semester. The following listing comes from a Data Quality   and Completeness report created especially  for the Student Billing Targeted Functional Assessment. The report is available on the reporting services  dashboard. The report is titled,   SB_New_Courses_Review .   Links to the report have also been created  on the Reports page of the Jenzabar EX workspace for select user groups (those who should be using the  report as part of standard procedure s ).

These require further study and perhaps   some additional information  before a judgement can be made.  RCC will need to keep track of new course offerings and ensure that they are correctly entered into the  Hours, Charges and Refunds tables during the semester they are first offered. This is a routine  maintenance task that cannot be automated. CampusWorks   has provided a separate document that  describes the current Hours, Charges and Refunds tables configurations. The document is titled, “How  Hours and Charges are C alculated ” and contains specific information for each of the Hours buckets,  Charge tables, a nd Refund tables data entry specifications.  Please reference the above document when amending the automated hours, charges and refunds  configurations.  A DJUSTING   C HARGES AND   F EES TO   C ONFORM TO   B OARD   A PPROVED   V ALUES   -   D ETAILS  RCC’s charges and fees are revised periodically by the Board of Trustees. Each time revisions are made,  the automated student billing configuration will need to be adjusted (Hours, Charges, and Refunds  tables). Assuming that policies remain constant and   changes are limited to dollar amounts, the  modifications will be straightforward.  Should significant policy changes be included in the board approved charges and fees schedules, the  task becomes substantially more complex, potentially to the point of restructuring the entire Hours,  Charges and Refunds “stack”. Should such changes be re quired, RCC will need to reprogram their entire  automated student billing configuration and retest the entire system. This would be an undesirable  circumstance and might require contracted expertise.  If the changes are limited to dollar amounts, the process is relatively simple:  1)   Start with a comprehensive list of the dollar amount changes.  2)   Identify the fee codes impacted by the changes.  3)   Modify the charge details for each fee code impacted by the board approved changes. If it is a  flat fee, modify the flat fee amount. If it is a per hour charge, modify the per hour charge  amount. 25  All of this is manual data entry/modification work. It must be carried out with care and precision.  Ideally, the individual making these changes will have deep knowledge of the existing configuration so  that they can proceed with confidence. If the indi vidual has any doubts about what they are doing they  should seek assistance.  D ATA   Q UALITY   A ND   C OMPLETENESS   R EPORTS   -   D ETAILS  After the above steps have been carried out it is time to begin assessing data quality and completeness.  Because the automated student billing is data driven, it is possible for incorrect data to have a negative  impact on the Student Charges results. Cam pusWorks has provided several data quality and  completeness reports intended to assist RCC in proactively correcting these types of data issues.  All of these reports are housed on the RCC Report Server, a.k.a. the Dashboard. These reports are also  linked to the Jenzabar workspaces for user groups expected to utilize them.  SB_New_Courses_Review   -   This report identifies Courses that have never been offered previously.  Courses not previously offered may not have the charges and refunds setup correctly. There is a chance  that these new courses need to be accounted for in the Charges and Refunds conf igurations for the term  specified. Examples include Nursing Course Fees, Nursing Semester Fees, Course Lab Fees, etc. This is a  Data QC Check for the Student Billing configuration. Any exceptions should be corrected prior to  running student charges.  SB_Wrong_Division_On_Course   -   This report identifies   Course   Sections and Student Course History  records where the Division Code assigned to the course appears to be incorrect. Correct Division Codes  on both the Student Record and the Section Master record are required in order for the Automated  Charges for Student   Billing to produce accurate results. This is a Data QC Check for Student Billing. Any  exceptions should be corrected prior to running student charges. Please notify the Registrar that data  corrections are required.  SB_Charges_Missing_Refunds   -   This report identifies Charge Definitions that do not have a  corresponding Refund Definition. The EX system requires refund definitions for every charge definition.  The one exception is \"Waiver\" charges. EX does not support the refunding of Negative cha rges, so  refund definitions are not required for Waivers.   The waivers   should always appear   in this report. Other  fee codes should not.   This is a Data QC Check for the Student Billing configuration. Any exceptions  should be corrected prior to running student charges.  SB_Review_NC_Course_Charges_Fees   -   This report lists the Non - Credit courses and the associated fees  / charges that are currently configured for each course. The charges listed are the actual charges  configured by way of the business office. If no charges are configured for a course the \"F lat Fee\" column  will be blank and the revenue will be 0.00.   The Corporate and Community Education office should be  reviewing this report frequently.   Any discrepancies should be reported to the business office  immediately in order to ensure that students are correctly billed. 26  SB_Enrolled_And_Not_Charged   -   This report identifies currently enrolled students who have no charges  associated with the year and term specified. This is a Data QC Check for Student Billing. It is possible  that charges have not yet been run for these students. Please run the Student   Charges using the  \"_Not_Charged_Yet\" or \"_All\" selection sets to remedy this problem. If there are still no charges for  some students, it could indicate a problem with the Charges table or it could indicate user error.  Technically, this is not a pre - billing report. However it is documented here as part of the report suite  delivered with the Student Billing targeted functional assessment.  C ONFIGURING   T ERM   G ROUP   C ONTROL   -   D ETAILS  Configuring the Term   Group Control is one of the last steps required prior to running Student Charges  for a semester. The Term Group Control for the new semester must be setup prior to attempting to run  any charges.  1)   Open   the   “Term Group Control” window.  2)   Locate the term you wish to configure. You may need to scroll through the list to find the term  of interest. In this example we are configuring the Fall term, FA. See Figure 26.  Figure 26   –   The “Term Group Control” window.  3)   Ensure that the “Override Refund Percentage” is always set to 0%.  4)   Ensure that the “Allow Registration to Override Defaults” checkbox is always unchecked. RCC  has no policy that allows enrollment staff to override the automated charges and refunds  settings. 27  5)   Ensure that the “Allow to Generate Charges” check box is checked for the “Business Office”  only. RCC should be running the charges as nightly batches until a conscious decision is made to  start automating the charge generation again. At this time there i s no compelling reason to  allow in - person or online registration to trigger the generation of student charges. [If it is too  early to generate charges for this particular year and term, be sure all three boxes are  unchecked.]  6)   Ensure that the “Charge Mode to be Created” is set to “Preliminary”. [Note: this setting only  affects Online and Registration charges creation. When running Student Charges in batch using  the “Student Charges” window, the selection made on that screen ta kes precedence.]  7)   Ensure that all other terms within the list have no checkboxes checked for the “Allow to  Generate Charges” options.  8)   Save these settings by clicking the “Save” button at the top left corner of your Jenzabar screen.  9)   Now check the “Term Group Control Relation” values by right - clicking on the Term of interest.  See figure 27.  Figure 27   –   “Term Group Control Relation” menu item.  The “Term Group Control Relation” window is now displayed. See Figure 28. 28  Figure 28   –   The “Term Group Control Relation” window  10)   Check to be sure the correct year and term are   selected on this screen. In this example the  selected year term is 2017 FA. If it is not the year term desired, select the item from the right  hand list and click on the “Remove” button.  11)   Now select the desired year term from the left hand list and click the “Add” button to move it to  the right hand list. There should only be one year term in the right hand list. RCC does not bill  multiple years and terms at the same time.  12)   Click the “Save” button to save your changes.  C ONFIGURING   S UBSIDIARY   C ONTROL   -   D ETAILS  In this section we will cover only two settings within the Subsidiary Control window, “Period End Date”  and “Statement Due Date”. These settings control certain outputs generated by the built - in student  account statement reports. Properly managing these   settings will ensure that the built - in reports are  complete and accurate each semester.  The “Period End Date” field   -   Only transactions with a date equal to or earlier than the   “Period End  Date”   are processed by the Statement   Reports   and Register runs. RCC should   set the period end date  appropriately to control which transactions are included on student statements. In most cases this  should be set to the Last End Date of the current semester.  The “ Statement Due   Date” field   -   RCC should set the payment due date based on current policy.  These two values should be set to appropriate values each semester in order for RCC to take advantage  of the built - in reporting tools contained in Jenzabar EX and the CRM (MyRCC). See Figure 29. 29  Figure 29   –   The “Subsidiary Control” window showing the “Period End Date” and “Statement Due Date”  fields.  CampusWorks recommends that RCC utilize the built - in reports in favor of custom reports (MS Access)  that have been in use for many years. The custom reports are not designed correctly to work with the  Jenzabar EX system architecture and are not responsive   to A/R configuration settings. This results in  ongoing issues for the business office. CampusWorks is confident that utilization of the built - in reports  will mitigate many of the issues being experienced today.  G ENERATING   S TUDENT   C HARGES   -   D ETAILS  Even though the charges calculations are automated within the system, the process for executing the  logic is not automatic. Generating charges (both   Preliminary and Actual) is accomplished by way of the  “Student Charges” window.  Within the “Student Charges” window there are several selections that must be made in order to  generate charges correctly. These selections must be consciously applied each time the “Student  Charges” tool is run. This work instruction will address the ge neration of charges for   all students   by  semester. Figure 30 shows the “Student Charges” window as it appears when first opened. 30  Figure 30   –   The “Student Charges” window.  1)   The first step when running charges is to specify which students should be processed. This is  controlled by the “Query:” selection drop - down. In this example we are running charges on ALL  students for the Spring 2017 term. Select “q_student_master_sp201 7_all” query from the drop -  down list. See Figure 31.  Figure 31   –   The “q_student_master_sp2017_all” query selection.  Note: There are several other possible selections that are also available.  “q_student_master_sp2017_ug”   –   Processes only Undergraduate Students.  “q_student_master_sp2017_nc”   –   Processes only Non - Credit Students. 31  “q_student_master_sp2017_not_charged_yet”   -   Processes only Students who have no charges  yet for the term specified. This option does not detect changes to student enrollment and is  not a good option when the goal is to keep charges current with course enr ollments.  “Individual”   –   The individual Checkbox can be used to run charges for a specific individual (by  ID Number). The Id Number must also be supplied.  2)   Ignore the “Run   Date For Transactions:” option. The default date should be adequate.  3)   Select the appropriate Year and Term for which you are generating charges. This option  controls which enrollment records are utilized to generate charges. See Figure 32.  Figure 32   –   The Year and Term selections.  4)   If the “Override Refunds” checkbox is checked   you must uncheck   it.   While this is an available  option within the system, there is never any circumstance where RCC should utilize this option.  The configuration delivered with the Student Billing targeted functional assessment is designed  to refund accounts correctly. The re will never be any need to override the refunds configured  for RCC.  5)   Set the “Charge Mode:” selection appropriately. The options are “Preliminary” and “Actual”.  Charges should always be run in “Preliminary” mode until the day following the close of the  add/drop period. After that, charges should always be run in “Actual”   mode for the remainder  of the billing cycle (the remainder of the semester). See Figure 33. 32  Figure 33   –   The “Preliminary” charge mode is selected.  6)   Ignore the “Override Refund Percentage:” option. There will never be any need to override the  refund percentages CampusWorks has configured for RCC.  7)   Ignore the “Report Title:” option unless your standard operating procedure involves the Printout  of charges generated by a particular run.  8)   Select either “Charges By Individual” or “Charges By Account” for the results output. Generally  speaking, the “Charges By Individual” option is most useful. But this is not a critical setting.  9)   Make sure that the “Print” option is   always   set to “Preview” unless you really want to send the  results to a printer. Selecting the “Preview” option conserves paper. See Figure 34 for the  correct selection.  Preliminary charges may be run   as soon as any students are registered for the term. The cutover  from Preliminary to Actual charges should be   purposeful and   abrupt. Once Actual charges are run for a  term   you must continue running Actual charges   for the remainder of the term.  CampusWorks recommends that all add/drop periods close at 11:59pm on the Census date. Actual  charges should be run   immediately   the following morning   (6:00am is ideal)   to ensure   that   all students  have   Actual   charges   applied to their accounts.   Failure to follow this recommendation will result in lost  revenue for RCC. Actual charges are required for the Refund/No Refund logic to be effective. 33  Figure 34   –   The “Preview” selection.  10)   Lastly, check your selections thoroughly prior to clicking the “OK” button. The cautions noted in  step 5 are very important. If you are satisfied with all of your selections click the “OK” button.  Status messages regarding process execution will be disp layed in the lower left corner of the  Jenzabar screen. See Figure 35.  Figure 35   –   Process execution messages in lower left corner.  Once the process is finished, the report “Print Preview” screen will be displayed. See Figure 36.  Figure 36   –   The Print Preview screen.  11)   Click the “X” in the upper right hand corner of the Print Preview screen to close the window.  I DENTIFYING   S TUDENTS   W HO   A RE   N OT   BEING CHARGED   -   D ETAILS  An important Data Quality and Completeness report has been created to ensure that all students  enrolled in a given semester have been charged. This report identifies students who have had no  charges generated. It does not validate that the charges are co rrect.  The link to this report has been placed within the Jenzabar workspace for any user group that needs  access to it. See Figure 37 for an example of how this report link might appear in your workspace. 34  Figure 37   –   The “SB_Enrolled_And_Not_Charged” report link.  This report is hosted on the executive “Dashboard” and can be accessed directly by clicking on this   link .  SB_Enrolled_And_Not_Charged   -   This report identifies currently enrolled students who have no charges  associated with the year and term specified. This is a Data QC Check for Student Billing. It is possible  that charges have not yet been run for these students. Please run the Student   Charges using the  \"_Not_Charged_Yet\" or \"_All\" selection sets to remedy this problem.  If there are still no charges for some students, it could indicate a problem with the Charges table or it  could indicate user error   when running Student Charges .   It is also possible that new course offerings  have not yet been entered into the Charge tables or Hours tables. See the “New Course Offerings” topic  within this document for additional information.  If user errors and new course offerings have both   been ruled   out, it may be appropriate to request that  an IT staff member analyze the problem. Ideally the IT staff member should have deep knowledge of  the automated charges features of the Jenzabar system. 35  R EVIEWING   S TUDENT   C HARGES   -   D ETAILS  As noted previously, when reviewing student charges for accuracy, users should utilize the “A/R Inquiry”  window. This report retrieves the complete history of all transactions (debits and credits) made to a  student’s account. No special instructions shou ld be required for “A/R Inquiry” report utilization. See  Figure 38.  Figure 38   –   The “A/R Inquiry” window. 36  S UGGESTED   T IMELINE   F OR   S TUDENT   B ILLING   CYCLES  E ND   O F   W ORK   I NSTRUCTIONS",
