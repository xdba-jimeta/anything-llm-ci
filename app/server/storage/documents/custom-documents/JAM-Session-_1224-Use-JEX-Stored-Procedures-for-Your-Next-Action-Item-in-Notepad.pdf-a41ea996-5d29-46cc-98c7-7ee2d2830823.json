June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Mark Schroeder  Wisconsin Lutheran College  Sat., June 4, 2016, 9:30-10:30am  #1224 Use JEX Stored Procedures for Your Next Action Item in Notepad © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Session Description  The relatively new Notepad capabilities ( using EX 6+ ) enhance our ability to manage user- defined needs for Items at an action code level. Learn how WLC put the pieces together. This includes separate user-defined tables, which keep DE & AD data apart. Notepad users can record results unique to their module-related actions. They can then opt to insert a selected next action, at a specified day and time, into a selected user's To-do List. On the Action code setup, user-defined columns control table insertion and formatting ( e.g. next action codes available in drop-down-data-window & formatting of Item_Description ). Customized action- code specific InfoMaker Forms control what is displayed and usable. Real-time updating is implemented through multiple database triggers on the Items table and on WLC's user-defined table for AD. The latter takes advantage of stored procedures. We chose some of them for inserting into the Items table. We slightly customized those SPs. As you can see, there are quite a few moving parts to make it all work for our particular scenarios. After attending this session, you can begin to envision how to assemble your own puzzle pieces in your EX Notepad environment to meet your users' needs too. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.
