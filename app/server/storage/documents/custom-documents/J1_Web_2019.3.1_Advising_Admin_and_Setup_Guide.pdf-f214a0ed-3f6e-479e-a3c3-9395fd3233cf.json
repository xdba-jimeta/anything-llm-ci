S   YMBOLS   U   SED IN THIS   M   ANUAL  A note is a message or reminder about a particular element that could help you make a decision in the process.  A tip is a trick or helpful hint that you may not know, but could help make your daily job and tasks easier and/or better.  A warning is a cautionary message that a certain change or click could have consequences in your system.  A bomb is an extreme warning, letting you know that whatever step or change you are about to make would impact or cause irreversible changes to your entire system.  An example is a storyboard or step-by-step (usually including images) that will show you how and why you would complete a process.  A key icon will let you know that the window/feature is limited by special permissions. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   2  S   ETTING   U   P   J1   W   EB   A   DVISING  There are several J1 Desktop and J1 Web processes and configurations that impact Advising Administration and Academic Advising users.  P   ERMISSIONS  Permissions set up in J1 Desktop and J1 Web determine what information and features users can access in J1 Web Academic Advising and Advising Administration.  J1   D   ESKTOP   R   OLES AND   P   ERMISSIONS  The J1 Web application uses information in J1 Desktop. To ensure that users have access to important Advising information, the Advisor, Advising Module Manager, or Department Head must have an Active Web Login and belong to the appropriate J1 Desktop user groups.  Detailed information about J1 Desktop user groups, permissions, and access is available in the J1 Desktop Online Help and in the J1 Web System Administration Guide available in the   J1 Module Resource Center   on   MyJenzbar.net .  Users must have an Active Web login (J1 Desktop   Users window,   Active Web Login checkbox).  Once users have an Active Web Login, all other web permissions and roles are maintained within J1 Web. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   3     Users must belong to the appropriate J1 Desktop advising groups and those groups have permissions to needed features and information (J1 Desktop   Group Definition   window,  Membership   button,   Group Membership   window).  o   Advisor should belong to the J1 Desktop AVUSER group  o   Academic Advising Module Manager should belong to the J1 Desktop AVMANAGER group  o   Department head should belong to the J1 Desktop AVUSER group  The Department Head may belong to other J1 Desktop groups depending upon the functions they are working with in J1 Desktop and J1 Desktop Advising.     Advisor, Academic Advising Module Manager, and Department Head must have access to the appropriate J1 Desktop Advising module functions (J1 Desktop   Group Definition   window,  Permissions   button,   Group Permissions   window). J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   4     Advisor, Academic Advising Module Manager, and Department Head must have advising access (J1 Desktop   Maintain Advising Access   window).  Detailed information about J1 Desktop groups, permissions, and advising access is available in the J1 Desktop Online Help . J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   5  J1   W   EB   R   OLES AND   P   ERMISSIONS  Roles and permissions further control access to Advising features and information. Module Managers and Advising Administrators can manage roles and permissions for Academic Advising to control what users can do and see in the Academic Advising hub. Roles can have multiple users assigned to them and a user can belong to multiple roles.  Before an Advising Administrator can manage academic advising roles, a System Administrator must add them to an Advising Administration role with role-related permissions or grant the role they belong to Academic Advising role permissions. Permissions can vary according to role, but advising administrators may be able to:  •   View roles and related role information  •   Update the role names and descriptions  •   Create new advising roles and copy existing ones  •   Update permissions associated with a role  •   Add and remove users to the advising roles  •   Delete roles no longer used  A   CADEMIC   A   DVISING   R   OLES   P   AGE  Use this page to work with advising roles at your school, including creating, copying, and deleting advising roles, and updating general advising role information.  Create several advising roles with varying permissions to give different users varying levels of access. For example, can create separate Department Head roles for each department at J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   6  your school and tailor their access to their appropriate   certification, c oncentration, minor,  or program .  C   REATE   R   OLES  Use the create role feature to create a new advising role based on the Jenzabar-provided Advising role templates. The wizard steps you through selecting the template and determining what permissions will be available with the role.  Step 1: Select the advising role template the new role will be based on. Jenzabar recommends updating the new role name and description to show how the role differs from the template. This can help distinguish which role users should be assigned to. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   7  Step 2: Select the permissions users assigned to the advising role will be granted. These permissions can be updated at a later time as needed. For example, if you determine you don’t want users to be able to view holds, you can disable the permission using the  Edit role   feature.  Exclamations mean permissions from another tool such as RMS or J1 Desktop apply and access to information may be limited.  Step 3: Access the   Edit role page for the role you just created. Grant the role access to students (does not apply to all roles) and add the appropriate users to the role. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   8  The Copy Role feature allows you to copy any existing advising role including advising roles you have created to create a new advising role. When you copy a role, the new role inherits the original’s permissions allowing you to quickly build a hierarchy of roles with increasing or decreasing permissions.  Like the Create Role wizard, the Copy Role wizard allows you to create a new role name and description as well as determine what permissions will be available with the role.  E   DIT   R   OLE   P   AGE  Use this page to view users associated with a role, manage the permissions associated with a role, and add and remove users to and from roles.  When a new permission is made available in a subsequent software release, it is available to be activated for any roles based on the Jenzabar-provided template.

All location managers must be an active J1 Web user (J1 Desktop   Users   window) assigned to this role with the appropriate location enabled. There are two ways to set up how location managers access students.     You can allow location managers to only work with students who have the J1 Web enabled location as their home campus (J1 Desktop Student Information window, Student tab, location information). For example, if you enable the West campus and a student’s home campus is the West campus, location managers will be able to see that student’s information.  OR     You can allow location managers to only work with students who have a J1 Web enabled location where the student can take courses (J1 Desktop Student Information window, Student tab, Course Locations tab). For example, if your school has a campus in New York, NY and a campus in Washington, DC and the student’s course location is in Washington DC, then the location manager for the Washington, DC campus will be able to work with the student.

Throughout various Advising processes, automated messages and tasks are sent to Advising Module Managers, advisors, advisees, and other users.  An advisor may receive a message letting them know the advising cycle has been published and they can set up their appointment blocks in order for students to select appointments.  Automated messages and tasks associated with an advising cycle can be set up by users in a module manager role. Other automated messages and tasks are generated by the system.  If an advisee requires course approval, the advisor receives a course approval task.  J1 Web users can send messages between one another, assign themselves and other users’ tasks, and set up email and task notification forwarding to their institutional or personal email. Detailed information is available in the   J1 Web Standard Features Guide   and Standard Features Online Help .  S   AMPLE   T   ASK  Users can create tasks for themselves or others, and automatically be assigned to tasks related to advising processes and milestones. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   17  S   AMPLE   M   ESSAGE  J1 Web users can send messages to each other and automatically receive messages related to advising processes and milestones.  T   ASK   &   M   ESSAGE   F   ORWARDING  Messages and tasks are standard features and do not require configurations. Advisors can opt to forward J1 Web message and task notifications to an email address using the   Account and Preferences  options. Advisees may also receive email notifications when appointments are available for selecting or when an advisor has approved their course registration.  For more information about message and task forwarding, see the   J1 Web System Administration Administrative Guide   available from the Online Help.  T   ROUBLESHOOTING  Why a user might not receive Advising-related messages and tasks:     The timeframe is between advising cycles and tasks and messages related to advising cycle milestones have not been set up yet.     User may not be assigned advisees for the current advising cycle and therefore has no milestones.  Why a user may not receive email notifications:     User (e.g., advisor, department head, advisee, etc.) may not be set up to receive emails or may not have a valid email address in J1 Desktop (J1 Desktop   Name Entity   window,   Addresses   tab).

J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   28  A   DVISING   C   YCLES  Advising cycles define advising milestones such as setting up the advisor’s available meeting times and the time when those meetings will end for a selected catalog year. This process keeps advisors and students engaged and Advising Module Managers aware of progress.  Advising cycles impact and are impacted by J1 Desktop, J1 Web, and JICS.  Did you know that you can conf igure   specific   groups of students to have permissions to edit  their academic plan in campus portal? This can save a lot of time meeting with students. If desired, it can be set up to require the advisor to approve the changes, or not. A System Administrator will need to do the setup. For more information see My Academic Plan Setup.  Advising cycles are associated with year/terms or subterms and student tel web registration groups to determine when advisors and appropriate advisees meet within the registration timeframe (advising cycles provide great flexibility and can take place before or during your registration period).  Academic Advising Module Managers   set the advising cycles up and monitor advisors and their advising student interactions as they step through the process. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   29  J1   D   ESKTOP   S   ETUP  The following J1 Desktop configurations need to be in place to ensure advising cycles can be set up correctly in J1 Web.     Year/terms or subterms should be set up in J1 Desktop and are designated as ready for advising cycle (J1 Desktop   Year Term Subterm   window,   Year Term   tab &   Year/term Control for Web Registration Groups   or   Subterm Control for Web Registration Groups   tabs). Advising cycle start and end dates typically coincide with those set up for the year/term or sub-term.  When the appropriate year/term or subterms are available, they can be associated with an advising cycle on the J1 Web Advising Administration hub,   Create Advising Cycles ,   Advising Cycles Basics   page. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   30     Web groups should be associated with the appropriate year/terms or subterms in J1 Desktop (J1 Desktop   Year Term Subterm   window). Advisees associated with the web group are automatically assigned to the associated advising cycle.  Academic Advising Module Managers can select the student web groups to be associated with the advising cycle on the J1 Web Advising Administration hub,   Create Advising Cycles ,   Select Student Web Groups   page. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   31     Advisees should be associated with a web group (J1 Desktop   Student Information   and/or J1 Desktop   Maintain Web Reg Group Code   window).  Advisees are then included with the student web groups associated with the advising cycle.

A   CADEMIC   P   LANNING  The academic planning process impacts the Advising Administration and Academic Advising hubs and users. This planning process takes the program curriculum set up by the Advising Module Manager and turns it into academic plans that can be used by advisors and advising students to map out which courses need to be taken to satisfy the requirements of their selected set of aims (e.g., major, minor, certification, Gen ED, etc.) and when. Plans can be copied from one year/term or subterm to another and updated as needed to save time repeatedly re-entering planning information.  Advising worksheet defines what the student needs to take and academic planning determines when they need to take the courses. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   33  The following outlines the J1 Desktop set up needed to implement academic planning. For information about specific planning blocks and pages for Advising Module Managers and Advisors, see the   Advising Administration hub   and   Academic Advising hub   sections. Detailed information and steps related to J1 Desktop set up are also available in the J1 Desktop Advising Online Help .  A   CTIVATING  In order for J1 Web academic planning to be implemented, the Advising Module Manager must activate it from the J1 Web   Advising Administration hub ,   Advising Settings . There are three modes: off, setup, and on.     Setup   allows Advising Administrators to build plans without making them available to advisors and students yet. Advising Administrators can build plans, share them with others, implement feedback, and designate them as ready to be published. However, the plans cannot be published until the Academic Planning Setting is turned to “On.” This ensures plans are not associated with students and advisors cannot access them until they are ready.  Your school is not required to use this setup mode. If you want Advising Administrators to be able to go directly from working with plans to publishing them, use the   On   option.     On   allows Advising Administrators to build plans share them with others, implement feedback, and publish them for advisors to use with their advising students.  Activating academic planning is a permanent configuration that impacts J1 Desktop and JICS workflows. Once it is activated, it cannot be deactivated. The process significantly enhances the advising process and to fully utilize the features in the Advising Administration and Academic Advising hubs, it is recommended your school activate academic planning. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   34 J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   35 J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   36  J1   D   ESKTOP   S   ETUP  To make aim curriculum available for planning in J1 Web, there are several steps in J1 Desktop that need to be completed.  Step One: Users set up institutional requirement trees to manage the aim requirements and academic planning details. To indicate these are being created, the user selects Building trees on the Options tab for each root requirement being developed.  Step Two: Once the trees are set up, users update the requirement status to Prep tree for plans ( Options   tab). This enables the   Academic Plans   tab where academic planning information can be entered.  Step 2: Enter planning information for specific requirements/courses or requirement groups. This is how information will appear to users in J1 Web. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   37  Similar to a single requirement, you can enter the plan name and hours as well as a group heading, the number of requirements associated with the group, and planning wizard information (shown to users in J1 Web).  This example shows planning information a single requirement/course.  This example shows planning information for a requirement group. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   38  The   Academic Plans tab is only available when the requirement is a required course or a group that has an OR relationship and is the last child in an AND ancestry string.  Step Three: User verifies the requirement trees are tested and accurate. If the requirement trees are inaccurate, academic plans will be inaccurate and student progress will be impacted.  Step Four: User makes the requirement tree ready for associating with a degree/aim for cross reference.  Step Five: User associates the requirement tree with a degree/aim.  Once the requirements are planned, update the aim to the   Ready for Degree/Aim Cross Reference   status.  Step 4: Designate the aim as ready for cross referencing with the Registration degree. J1 Web 2019.3.1 – Advising Admin & Setup Guide   39  Degree/aims designated as   Not ready for plan appear in the   Program Planning   block in J1 Web to let Advising Administrators know the institutional requirement trees have not been finalized.  When updates to a requirement tree associated with a degree/aim have been made, a “needs review” status is assigned to the programs/plans in J1 Web.  For detailed information about setting up institutional requirement trees and creating the degree/aim cross reference see the J1 Desktop Online Help.  T   ROUBLESHOOTING  Why a user might not see advising tree information:     User might not be assigned to a J1 Desktop group with access to requirement tree functions. Reference the   J1 Web Roles and Permissions   section and J1 Desktop Online Help for more information.     Requirement trees may not have been created yet. Requirements can be created using the J1 Desktop   Institutional Requirement Trees   window and the J1 Web Advising Administration,   Copy Program Requirements   page.  Step 5: Create the degree/aim cross reference and designate it as ready for plan.  Once cross reference is created, update it to the   Ready for plan   status. This makes it available in J1 Web (Advising Administration hub,   Program Planning   block).

Depending on how it is set up, students may be able to edit their plans, also. This can be a valuable time-saver for advisors, allowing certain groups of students to edit their plans online, saving the time to meet in person. If students have permissions to edit plans, they can move requirements or courses to other terms, choose the course they will take to meet requirements, and even add or remove a term from their plan. System Administrators can set this up to require Advisor approval for changes, or for no permission required. Students use My Academic Plan in the Campus Portal, and advisors approve changes in J1 Web, if required. For more information on setting My Academic Plan, see   My Academic Plan Setup .  Student plan approvals can show up in a couple of places on J1 Web: as a block on the Academic Advising hub, or as a page. If you go to a student's Student page and they have pending requests, you may get an alert with a link that will take you to the Student Plan Approvals page.  If a student (who requires advisor approval) has made changes to a plan but not yet requested approval, the advisor will not be able to make any changes to that plan until the student either cancels the changes or submits the approval request.
