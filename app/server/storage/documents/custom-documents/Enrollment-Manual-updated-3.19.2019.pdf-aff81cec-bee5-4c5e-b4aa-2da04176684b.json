When creating a new letter, you will   need to use the “New Action” button. To  modify an Action use the “Edit Action” button. Page   27  2)   Define Merge Document  -   If creating a new document, you will need to “Add Row”.  -   If modifying an existing document you will need to “Edit Document Definition”.  -   For all email Actions, the document definition should be modelled after the “EACCP”  document definition. Page   28 Page   29  -   It is okay to reuse the r_mailmerge_accpt_jef query.  -   Must create the Email HTML template. Use the EACCP.htm file as a basis, copy it first and  r ename it, then edit it in KompoZer.  -   Must create a Datafile. Jenzabar won’t do this for you. Copy one of the data files and  rename it to match the Action Name, i.e. EACCP.txt can be copied to ECONA.txt (for email  conditional acceptance letters.)  -   Setup the   “Email Options” to suit the purpose of the letter. Okay to reuse most of what you  see here with perhaps the Subject line being changed.  -   TEST, TEST, TEST.

Preferably using the “Testing  123” student account.  3)   Add the New action to whatever Action List you want to add the email to. This is usually the  Action List that is triggered by a stage change, such as conditional acceptance st age.

RCC require official transcripts from the institutions where credit   was earned for credit to  transfer.  B.   For Eligible transfer credits, the courses must have been taken at an institution accredited by  one of the six regional accreditation agencies in the United States or, when allowed by college  practice, by a national accr editation agency recognized by the Council for Higher Education  Accreditation (CHEA). Consult your college about any special requirements for online courses.  C.   Credit earned at international institutions not accredited by one of the six regional United  Sta tes accreditation agencies may transfer, they need to get their credentials evaluated by CED  or WES.  D.   Only   credit   for   college - level   coursework   will   transfer.   Credit   for   pre - college - level   or  developmental coursework does not transfer. However, RCC use developmental coursework for  student placement purposes.  E.   Audited coursework does not transfer.  F.   Grades d o not transfer; only credit transfers. Therefore, transfer credit grades are not used in  calculating grade or quality point averages. Consult your college for any exceptions.  G.   Credit will transfer as (1) the course equivalent at the receiving institution,   if it exists, or (2) as  an elective equivalent within a comparable department, if it exists.  H.   RCC requires a minimum grade of C (2.00 on a 4.00 scale) or higher for courses and credits to  transfer.  I.   Grades of Pass (P), Satisfactory (S) or similar grades   will transfer only when official transcripts  indicate that such grades are equivalent to a grade of C or higher. This is usually found on the  back of the transcript which is the Legend.  J.   RCC can transfer up to 45 total credits. We require students to com plete at least one quarter  (25%) of the credits of the first associate degree at that institution in order to graduate (referred  to as the residency requirement).  K.   Credit will be granted for satisfactory scores on Advanced Placement (AP) examinations based  on institutions’ policies. Official score reports from the College Board are required in order to  receive credit for AP.   See attachment regarding AP scores  L.   Credit will be granted for satisfactory scores on College - Level Examination Program (CLEP)  examina tions based on institutions’ policies.

Dual Enrollment students do not complete the regular admissions application.  - Please note that the Dual Enrollment application must include signature of the stud ent’s  parent/guardian and high school official (unless the student is homeschooled) on the bottom of  page one: Page   71  - They must also submit their official high school transcript (a minimum GPA of 2.5 is required  to qualify for the Dual Enrollment program).  - Other qualifications include being a resident of the state of Massachusetts, are currently enrolled  as a high school student (or a homeschool student), and has not yet earned their high school  diploma or HiSet.  - Only for - credit college - level courses qualif y for Dual Enrollment (i.e. non - credit and  developmental courses do not qualify).  - Dual Enrollment funds are not guaranteed, and will only cover for   one   course per student in  order to maximize the number of students who are able to participate.  - After the   Dual Enrollment application is processed and the student has an ID#, they must take  the placement test section for the course they want (i.e. the math placement for a math course).  Ability to register as a Dual Enrollment student is contingent upon scoring   at the appropriate  level on the placement test or otherwise fulfilling the prerequisite for the course desired.  - Provided they successfully achieve a qualifying score on their placement test, or have otherwise  fulfilled the prerequisite, they would then r egister through the Advising Office as normal.  Processing a Dual Enrollment Application  When processing a Dual Enrollment application, you will be completing many of the same fields  as for a normal Admissions application in Maintain Candidacy. Please note   the following  differences or important information:  -   Parent/Guardian Emergency Contact and FERPA   -   The student’s parent or guardian will be  listed on the application, and they will be entered in as the emergency contact. If the student is  under 18 then t he need for FERPA permission does not apply, the student’s parent/guardian may  have access to their information. If the student is over 18 then the usual FERPA standards apply.  -   SASID #   -   the high school official should list the student’s SASID # in the “ Recommendation  of School” section. All students attending a Massachusetts high school will have an SASID #,  only homeschooled students will not, and otherwise the application will not be considered  complete with the SASID #. You will enter the SASID # unde r the “Attributes” tab in Maintain  Candidacy, just add a row and select the code “SASID” and enter the number in the description  field. Page   72  - Candidacy   –   formatting the Candidacy tab for a Dual Enrollment student correctly is very  important.     “Program”   –   this will usually will be entered as DUALE for Dual Enrollment. However,  sometimes we do accept DE students from specific programs like RoxMapps or Jeremiah  E. Burke High School. Carrie or the program coordinator will let you know if the studen t  is applying with a specific program, otherwise simply use DUALE.     “Type of Student” will be D for Dual Enrollment.     “Degree”   –   Dual Enrollment students are listed as ND for Non - Degree.     “Requirements”   –   when completing the Requirements tab, please delete th e row for High  School Self - Certification as that is not required for Dual Enrollment students.     “Stage”   –   when you are finished with the application, the student’s stage must be set to  Stage 12 for Dual Enrollment.  - Admissions to Registration   –   Then run an   Admissions to Registration for the semester. Make  sure that your Admissions to Reg is set up to include Stage 12 students. Afterwards, please  double - check the Degree tab in Student Information to make sure the student is properly listed as  Dual Enrollment.  - File   –   Then create the students’ file and label. Please include that they are a Dual Enrollment  student on the label. DE students’ files are kept separate in the cabinet outside of Carrie’s office  with the “Dual Enrollment” label on it.  Registration  - Fro m there, testing and registration proceeds normally. After a Dual Enrollment student  registers (it will be listed on the registration form), let Carrie know and provide her with a copy  of the student’s schedule.  Special Notes on the HSICE Program  Each semester during registration periods, you will receive applications and registrations from  Karen Walker for the ICE program students. The ICE program is detailed   in this link   but in  short, it’s a program for high school students aged 18 to 22 with mental disabilities to help them  increase their academic success in a college environment with courses and professors who   will  assist them.  Karen does the work in determining if students are eligible and selecting the appropriate courses  for the students, so we just need to enter in their information into Maintain Candidacy and then  register the student for their selected co urse. While this is largely similar to Dual Enrollment,  there are a few important differences. If any issues come up (like a course section being full)  please let Karen know, she is super flexible and easy to work with in resolving issues.  - Karen will prov ide her own HSICE application and accompanied registration, which is then  returned to her after we process the students’ information as Karen maintains the files for HSICE  students. We only need to keep the white page of the Registration form, as usual. Page   73  - The procedure for entering in a HSICE student is almost exactly the same as a Dual Enrollment  student. The only difference is the “Program.” For their program you will select the code  “HSICE” for High School ICE program. Make sure to double - check Student I nformation after  you run the Admissions to Registration to make sure everything is in properly.  - Registration . All HSICE students are auditing the courses they are enrolled in   –   they will not  be graded for the course. So   when you enter in the course code for registration, before you hit the  “Register” button,   you must first change the “Credit Type” to “AU” for audit . It is best to do  this before registering the course, but if you forget you can also change it on the regis tered  course. It is very important to make sure that the credit type is changed to AU for audit before  returning the paperwork to Karen. Page   74  Procedure for Business Office Forms (Encumbrance, ATP,  Travel documents)  Overall Notes   for All Business Office Forms     All Business Office forms are available on the excel spreadsheet “Business Office Forms  – Revised 2 - 22 - 2017.” Make sure you are using the most up - to - date forms. This is saved  in the   S:// Drive   within the folder   “For Carrie_EA”   (you may rename this folder if you  would like). In this excel sheet you will find all business - office - related forms   –  Encumbrance, ATP (Authorization to Pay), Travel (other), Travel (AFSCME), Travel  Advance Request, Travel Voucher, and Budge Change Reques t.       You will also find in the EA folder the   “Expenditure Classification Handbook”   which  tells you the Object Classes and Codes, and   “Accounts Payable Process”   which was  created by the Business Office as a quick reference guide for submissions.     For every f orm you will   need   to enter the Cost Center Number, Object Class, and Object  Code. Page   75     Cost Center Number: each department has its own Cost Center Number associated with  its budget, so the Cost Center Number lets the Business Office know which department’s  budg et is paying. Here are important Cost Center Numbers to know:  o   Registration/General Enrollment Office needs: 4010  o   Admissions: 4015  o   Dual Enrollment: 6065  o   Project Access: 4045  o   Professional Development: 2040     Object Class and Object Code: these identify what is   being purchased/paid for. Check the  Expenditure Classification Handbook to find out the Object Class (two letters) and Object  Code (one or two letters followed by one or two numbers).  o   For example, if you are ordering general office supplies such as pens,   folders, etc.  those are covered under Object Class EE (Administrative Expenses) and Object  Code E01 (Office and Administrative Supplies). You can use the table of contents  which lists the title of each class, or simply use ctrl +F to search for the item y ou  are ordering.     You will also want to cross - reference the budget report to make sure we have the funds  allotted for the Object Class. You can locate the budget report in the G:// Drive. Make  sure to choose the excel sheet for the correct Fiscal Year and t hen on the sheet select the  Cost Center that you wish to view.  o   If any changes need to be made for budget allotment, then consult with the Cost  Center Manger to submit a Budget Change Request to the Business Office.     Before submitting any forms to the Business Office, they be first have the correct  signatures. All Business Office forms must be signed by the Cost Center Manager, which  in most cases is Carrie (for Admissions, Enrollment, Project Access, etc.). However, i f  the amount of funds requested in over $1,500, then it must also be signed by the Major  Budget Unit head, which would be Vice President Regner.     Business Office forms and attached paperwork must be brought up to the Business Office  in person as you will ne ed to log each order at Sandra’s desk. Use the stamper on the  desk for each submission and write a log entry for each submission on the clipboard.     Make sure to save each Encumbrance (or other form) you fill out, you can then refer back  to it easily when yo u need to complete an ATP.  o   I recommend saving Encumbrances (and all other Business Office forms) for  about six months, or possibly longer if it is a vendor that you anticipate needing to  order from again in the future (for example, Proforma from which we   order our  registration forms).  o   For particularly important orders (like travel), I will also scan in the signed copy  as a .pdf as a backup in case any issues come up. Page   76  Encumbrance  The encumbrance is to be submitted   to place an order through the Business Office. It is  submitted along with either a quote from the company’s sales representative, or a printout from  the company’s catalogue of the items showing the items to be purchased and the price.  Whenever ordering so mething, only an Encumbrance is submitted. The ATP is not submitted  until after receiving an invoice. However, if an order was placed without a prior encumbrance  form (for example, degrees from Jostens that we can order from directly), then an encumbrance  must also be prepared with the ATP and invoice.  What Must Be Completed on an Encumbrance Form: Page   77     The Cost Center number, Object Class, and Object Code on top.     Vendor name and information filled out as fully as possible (address and a phone number  at the ver y least).     List yourself as the name for “Prepared By” and your phone extension (so that Business  Office knows who to contact if there need to be any changes) and who you are preparing  it for.     Then list the items being purchased . If you have an item number, please include that in  the description field. The form is coded so that by putting the number of items in the  quantity column, and the price in the Unit Price column, the total will automatically be  generated in the Total Pric e. Make sure to double - check with your own total to make sure  everything is consistent and accounted for.  Make sure to get the correct signatures   –   Cost Center Manager for all, Major Budget Unit head  for requests over $1,5000.  Submit upstairs to the Busin ess Office with attached quote and log it in.  Save in the S Drive folder for Business Office paperwork (use the saved encumbrance for easy  reference when you must prepare the ATP). Page   78  ATP  The ATP form is submitted   with the invoice for payment. Invoices can come directly to us via  mail or email, or will be sent to us from the Business Office.  Remember if the order had not been made by encumbrance/the Business Office, then you must  also include the Encumbrance form   with the ATP and invoice. Page   79  What Must Be Completed on the ATP Form:     The Cost Center number, Object Class, and Object Code on top.     Vendor name     Date the invoice was received     Total cost     Invoice Number     List yourself as the name for “Prepared By” and your phone   extension (so that Business  Office knows who to contact if there need to be any changes) and who you are preparing  it for.  If you have the Purchase Order Number then please include that, however you will not always  have the number listed on the invoice so   it is not necessarily “required”  Make sure to get the correct signatures   –   Cost Center Manager for all, Major Budget Unit head  for requests over $1,5000.  Submit upstairs to the Business Office with the attached invoice and log it in.  Save in the S Drive f older for Business Office paperwork  - Work - Related Travel   –   Additional Documents  Submitting expenses for advance/prior to travel  When submitting for travel to be paid by the school/for an advance, then you must complete an  Encumbrance, an ATP, and two othe r forms   –   A Travel Authorization Request, and a Travel  Advance Request. As always, the Cost Center Number, Object Class, and Object Code (whether  for in - state or out - of - state travel).  - If the traveler is an AFSCME member, then make sure to complete the “T ravel   –   AFSCME”  version of the Authorization Request. For anyone else, they will be using the “Travel   –   Other”  version.  - For the Travel Authorization Request, in addition to the cost center manager, it also needs  signatures from the VP of Admin. And Financ e (VP Hepner) and President Roberson.  - For the Travel Advance Request, travelers can request up to 80% of an advance for their  anticipated expenses (the form will calculate this for you). It must be signed by the traveler and  the cost center manager.  - Travel Advances are paid to the traveler as an advance check. If any travel - related payments  need to be made directly elsewhere (for example, to a conference association for registration  fees) then you’ll have to create an additional Encumbrance/ATP for t hat (remember one for each  “vendor”). Page   80  Submitting expenses after travel  When submitting expenses after travel (gas, meals, etc.) in addition to Encumbrance/ATP, you  would also submit Travel Voucher Form along with the appropriate receipts. Enter the expen ses  accordingly to the appropriate columns. It must be signed by both the traveler and the Cost  Center Manager.",
