Presented by : Donna Adams, Mount Saint Mary College, Newburgh New York Bob Toews, Goshen College, Goshen Indiana  May 28 to 31, 2014 – Washington, DC  #187 Round Pegs and Round Holes – Not in AV © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     4 yr. Private Institution w/3 Masters Programs     2700 total student body     16 different start times (semester, hybrid, accelerated)     27 Majors     Minors, Certifications and Concentrations     5 year programs (internal and external)     Known for Nursing and Education program     Curriculum changes must pass curriculum and faculty senate. They take affect the next advising year.  Who We Are  Mount Saint Mary College   Goshen College     4 yr. Private Institution w/4 Masters Programs     900 total student body     Traditional Semesters and     40 Undergraduate Majors     47 Minors     Known for Nursing, Pre Med, International Education  2 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     Full time Faculty Advisors Advise and teach.     Some Faculty are new and innovative, some Faculty are not.     AV worksheets are used alone or in conjunction with paper plans of study, or in conjunction with printed transcripts.     Sometimes we even hear, “courses are missing on the worksheet”     Advisors are sometimes challenged to use the tools effectively.  Faculty Advisors  3 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Advising Module for both of us up and running 7 years now   (last 5 years really well for MSMC)  Best mapped out plans still have exceptions. AIMS should work with each other. GEN ED (CORE) AIM, Major AIM, Minor AIM, *FREE AIM, TOTALCR AIM. Separate AIMS allow for ease of Curriculum updating each year.  Where is the first priority for a course that fulfils multiple requirements in different AIMS? Minor? Major? Gen Ed? Ok, I get this ! This is easy.....  This is the Round Peg, fitting in the Round hole scenario .   4 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     You mapped it and planned it and decided that your first most important priority lies with the Major, then Core, then Minor.     You set XYZ 1010 in Major with Priority 1= 1 and Priority 2=1 (1,1, Y) and yes, reuse.     Then in Core you set XYZ 1010 with Priority 1=2 and Priority 2=1 (2,1, N) no reuse.     Now all the required courses in every Major will be the same (1, 1, Y). This works!  I got this all figured out, I’ll be done in no time!  5 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     Curriculum met and now XYZ 1010 is part of a new program. HSR Major and Minor now offered.     I will set XYZ 1010 in the Minor as (1,5, Y). I got this!     Wait! What’s the institution’s policy on sharing Major and Minor courses? No, no sharing!     What? PSY Major requires XYZ 1010 and student just declared HSR Minor and XYZ 1010 went to Major first (1,1, Y) and my Minor priority is set up (1,5, Y) then the Core, but No, I don’t want it in Major AND Minor. Ok, I will just Bypass Minor...  What? Why not? Well then, I will make it fit!  6 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Too many Alterations, Bypass! Now what??     I bypassed XYZ 1010 so many times this week!     Should I re-think my tree building? Nah, Curriculum is just stupid.     What should I do? Hit up the list-serve?     Too many Alterations and Bypasses is an indicator that your trees are not running at top production.     First things first, I suppose I can’t assume every course goes to Major first, then Core. I have Minor’s, Certifications and Curriculum rules to follow.   7 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Do not try to fit it! Work smarter, not harder!  No Square Pegs in Round Holes, but if every course is a Round Peg, doesn’t it need a Round Hole?  Who said every course is a Round Peg?  8 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Think outside the box!  Courses are as individual/unique as you are  Build your trees based on the importance of the course, NOT the importance of the AIM.  9 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     This is why it is very important to know your Institutions requirements Inside and Out.     Changes go into effect the following academic year in which they were approved.     Faculty advisors often forget how the process works and will often contact me asking why a junior can’t use XYZ 3000 to fulfill their CORE as the course was just passed last year.     This is the beauty of the Advising Requirement Year!  Not all the same! Individuality!  10 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     Well, XYZ 1010 has become very popular as it is now in a minor and can be used with a number of different majors.  Solution to XYZ 1010  11 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Incorporating Curriculum changes, and when!     At MSMC, I build the trees and I receive all curriculum approvals. Occasionally I attend Curriculum Committee meeting and/or Academic Standards Committee.     Yes, I do question what I receive if it is not clear enough.     At the time of year, first week of April, I copy my trees to new year (all at once). I make all curriculum changes on the new year.     I am then set for AD to RE of new transfer students beginning the 2 nd   week of April and by May, Incoming Freshmen AD to RE.  12 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     Cross listed (Dual Listed) courses  •   Across disciplines  •   More than 1 discipline  •   Across divisions  •   Count in both area disciplines (ART/HIS)  Challenges faced with updates/additions  When it is across multiple disciplines, is it a water- down version of the course? Who is benefiting?  Can you control cross divisional courses on the AV worksheet?  13 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     *FREE_G   is a Root     There are 3 GROUPS in it.     Each Group has courses listed with Priority 5, 0 No Reuse.     0.00 HRS Needed, 0 Count Needed     Shows as NOT MET     Recent changes in curriculum have me rethinking this and separating them.  Creating a Group that is disguised as *FREE  14 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  You can always re-think your tree building!  Questions before we move on.....  15 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.

Bottom Line.....  Each shape (ARC) needs it’s own shaped hole to fit it. Then they all come together, no matter which column or row (AIM) to form this puzzle (AV Worksheet) which guides and grows with students during their time at your institution.  And if you forget something, or want to change what you have, or just want to clean up your data..... run/create a query!  25",
