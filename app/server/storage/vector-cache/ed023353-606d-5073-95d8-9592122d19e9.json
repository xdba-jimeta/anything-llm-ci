Presented by  Mary Anne Lee, Madonna University  May 28 to 31, 2014 – Washington, DC  208 Educating Advisors on Courses, ARC’s, Aims, Trees and Their Relationship to Each Other © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Why would we want to educate our advisors in the Office of Academic Advising on Courses, Arc’s, Aims and Trees and how they are related?     New advisors - new to the University and new to advising students -  now using the Graduation Audit report, Advising Worksheet and ASR     We also have faculty who have taken on the role of advising students  or they just want a refresher on using Jenzabar     The advisors felt they needed to understand the relationships  between courses, ARC’s and trees and how they appear on the  reports  Educating Advisors © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  The Plan:  Find a simple explanation on the relationship between courses, ARCs, and trees.   Nothing technical such as groups or priorities.  The Solution :  1.   Create a short presentation"}},{"id":"ca03b391-940f-4dbd-848b-aaecbdfebd59","values":[0.05955702066421509,0.07891765236854553,0.023706620559096336,0.05241497978568077,0.07033074647188187,-0.03264137730002403,-0.056877899914979935,-0.04166465252637863,0.004117903765290976,0.06627905368804932,-0.009119298309087753,-0.020914960652589798,0.012693701311945915,-0.0036452726926654577,-0.02252761460840702,-0.011091950349509716,-0.07123405486345291,-0.026831241324543953,0.03218059986829758,-0.03405838832259178,0.06016378104686737,0.006975184660404921,0.04109593480825424,0.0025275233201682568,-0.0028771692886948586,0.02652847021818161,-0.017502568662166595,0.008254620246589184,-0.06025296822190285,-0.059309687465429306,-0.0004641967825591564,0.07067766785621643,0.045808155089616776,0.05148426443338394,-0.023278364911675453,-0.002998634474352002,0.012780017219483852,0.03331137076020241,0.016744159162044525,0.007280860096216202,-0.06401173770427704,-0.001474703662097454,0.02557140216231346,0.01113667618483305,-0.03634703904390335,-0.08492689579725266,-0.07486221194267273,-0.1336212456226349,-0.021104291081428528,0.10357549041509628,-0.03213294968008995,-0.02114129438996315,-0.10142266750335693,-0.06705215573310852,-0.028213955461978912,0.05433949455618858,-0.018941476941108704,-0.030632488429546356,-0.06182115525007248,-0.04212852939963341,-0.04615223407745361,0.003904063953086734,-0.09160161763429642,-0.01131835300475359,-0.0472789891064167,-0.001179784769192338,-0.02133970335125923,0.09206842631101608,0.04253382608294487,-0.019489718601107597,-0.0176086463034153,-0.03016917034983635,-0.09507936984300613,-0.010801726952195168,0.05521043762564659,0.02787914127111435,0.052271679043769836,0.1043958067893982,-0.02872103452682495,-0.10676419734954834,-0.013697279617190361,0.08110418170690536,-0.017347857356071472,0.02007387951016426,0.0448385626077652,0.002621934749186039,0.045311860740184784,-0.023589711636304855,-0.05074455589056015,0.028232814744114876,0.02766069397330284,-0.038760241121053696,0.005139485001564026,-0.006910637021064758,0.08473294228315353,-0.012543288059532642,-0.04489699751138687,-0.07501477748155594,0.06179047003388405,0.022632241249084473,-0.045410897582769394,0.0641772523522377,0.006565392017364502,-0.046445924788713455,-0.1438450664281845,-0.043420761823654175,0.022397061809897423,0.016301969066262245,0.0512835867702961,0.02423115260899067,0.06511344015598297,-0.0017140143318101764,-0.014218811877071857,-0.020532652735710144,0.07206453382968903,0.07398978620767593,-0.050371840596199036,0.006696725729852915,0.084160216152668,0.11791539937257767,-0.0013302593724802136,0.04038728028535843,0.005746972747147083,-0.05244933068752289,-0.05651838332414627,-0.09142609685659409,-0.06305281072854996,4.955732838169096e-33,0.03854244574904442,0.09215354174375534,-0.003155744168907404,0.06425382941961288,-0.0036654521245509386,0.04708606377243996,-0.038381993770599365,0.07037468254566193,-0.013670770451426506,0.08648476749658585,-0.04678544029593468,0.12576213479042053,0.013589909300208092,0.06441942602396011,0.06665954738855362,-0.02860056422650814,0.012649180367588997,0.07041256874799728,-0.030626505613327026,0.029020819813013077,0.009044489823281765,-0.065566286444664,0.06127176806330681,-0.07527648657560349,0.053934495896101,-0.006966684479266405,0.020583519712090492,0.05609381943941116,-0.04284011200070381,0.012992599047720432,0.02920464798808098,-0.02746608480811119,-0.05860939621925354,-0.04850338399410248,0.02592921070754528,0.054850801825523376,-0.008797682821750641,-0.019951913505792618,0.01601528562605381,-0.08320768922567368,-0.053954653441905975,0.029661118984222412,0.062255680561065674,-0.017010031268000603,-0.0030106022022664547,0.05805889144539833,0.0021254175808280706,-0.002686132909730077,0.11436482518911362,0.02348899468779564,-0.05518136918544769,-0.09396526217460632,0.00426887022331357,-0.05177554488182068,-0.028402693569660187,0.060142386704683304,-0.002410314278677106,0.003183413064107299,-0.05634239688515663,-0.012513676658272743,0.011680289171636105,0.025517288595438004,-0.019289616495370865,0.005523566156625748,-0.04505866393446922,0.03646930307149887,-0.07158204913139343,-0.05768279358744621,0.16521349549293518,-0.11087922751903534,-0.11142317950725555,0.008300287649035454,0.03348838910460472,-0.01691644825041294,0.007754033897072077,0.0029243247117847204,0.000018216795069747604,-0.03973814472556114,-0.003935057669878006,0.08558110892772675,-0.0072667356580495834,-0.08402267098426819,0.047567736357450485,-0.12618136405944824,0.05840955302119255,0.053894102573394775,0.08674874156713486,0.002722428645938635,-0.0028711010236293077,0.017038533464074135,0.008185677230358124,0.008619964122772217,-0.038945090025663376,0.11952651292085648,0.06455891579389572,-6.507860721782629e-33,0.0386868417263031,0.032835256308317184,0.008152349852025509,-0.0690588429570198,0.1224980503320694,0.04498792812228203,-0.08876653760671616,-0.0767202377319336,-0.019378524273633957,-0.05715269222855568,-0.05435037985444069,-0.023

How are they connected?     First is an explanation of the summary section of the Graduation Audit report, then Plan of Study, a course, ARC and finally Trees.  Where do I start? © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Why the summary section of the Graduation Audit Report?   Because it contains a student’s Aims, bulletin year, hours needed, hours earned, hours in progress, and GPA, etc.  AIMS are the individual items that are assigned to each student.  All of the AIMS together compose the student’s complete plan of study. © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.
