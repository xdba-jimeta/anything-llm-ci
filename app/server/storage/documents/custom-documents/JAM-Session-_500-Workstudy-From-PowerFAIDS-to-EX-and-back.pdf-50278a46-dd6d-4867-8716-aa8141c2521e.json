Setup – FAM cont.     There are two ways to get the information from FAM to PA One at a time © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Reports - FAM     Sample report of the information sent to PA.     But what happens when you need to make changes? © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Reports - FAM     You must make sure Payroll has pulled the data before making any changes. Otherwise errors will occur. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     This confirms that the update has now been sent to PA and from a Financial Aid perspective, we are now waiting for the student to be paid. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  PF_WRK_STDY table  When Financial aid sends the data to payroll, it populates the PF_WRK_STDY table. Payroll takes this data and looks for a matching position based on the fund code and work study department. The WKSTDY_ACTION_CDE is a key piece. A – create a new position in payroll U – update an existing position in payroll D – delete an existing position in payroll © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Setup the Organization Position  The Financial Aid office will need to provide the Payroll office with a list of all of the combinations of fund code and workstudy departments that students will be working in. Payroll then needs to create a position for each combination if one does not already exist. In this presentation, we are using only fund code 250 and we have a student working in department AH4. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Setup the Organization Position  The account number in the Budget Information section of the Organization Position window is the account number that will be assigned to the employee’s position when it is created by the Update Workstudy Employees process. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Update Workstudy Employees   This option is typically found under the Payroll Processing Activity Center.   Select the number of tax periods and pay periods that you want it to create on the position.   Choose the group code and subgroup code that you want it to give the new employee when it creates the employee master. Or if it is an Update, it will update the group code/subgroup code on the existing employee master.   Uncheck the autogenerate taxes and benefits if the employees are not to have taxes and benefits automatically created.   Choose Preliminary report to run it in trial mode first to check for errors. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  This report will list all of the students with the information it is going to use for the position. View the information for any errors once it is free of errors, re-run the Update Workstudy Employees option again but this time uncheck the Preliminary Report option to actually create the employee and/or position.  Update Workstudy Employees © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Some errors you may see...  Your IT staff will need to edit the PF_WRK_STDY table and change the WKSTDY_ACTION_CDE from A to U. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Some errors you may see...  The second error is the one causing the problem Usually fixing that one corrects both errors. Your IT staff will need to edit the PF_WRK_STDY table and change the WKSTDY_ACTION_CDE from U to an A. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Update Workstudy Employees © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  New Employee Master was created  The original hire date is pulled from the start date of the POE Definition setup by Financial Aid. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  New Employee Master was created  The group code and subgroup code came from the selections on the Update Workstudy Employees window. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  New Employee Position was created  The Start and End Dates come from the POE Definition. Everything else is pulled from the Organization Position. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  New Employee Earnings was created  Effective date is the Start date from the POE Definition. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  New Employee Earnings was created  Pay rate and earnings were pulled from the student employment data that was sent to payroll into the pf_wrk_stdy table. Default hours: eligibility amount divided by wage divided by number of pay periods 1000.00/8.00/12= 10.42 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Running a payroll – setup payroll controls  The workstudy year and workstudy term must match the row in the Payroll POE Cross Reference table. Financial Aid needs to let payroll know when they move from one year/term to the next. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Running a payroll – create timecards  You can use the Generate Timecards feature to automatically create timecards for all workstudy students (would need to customize the query to select the group/subgroup code). Or you can create the timecards manually. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Run Pay Run Edit © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Run Paychecks/Direct Deposits/Registers © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Update Payroll © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Update Payroll  The update payroll process populates the PA_WRK_STDY_EDIT table. This is the table the Workstudy Update From Payroll option looks at. It will pull only rows where FA_RETRIEVED = N  ID_NUM   POE_ID   FUND_CDE   DEPT_CDE   GROSS_PAY   RG_OT_HRS   FA_RETRIEVED 100298   20   195   SA4   155.00   22.99   Y 142099   20   195   BU4   128.75   25.00   Y 157887   25   204   CH6   83.33   11.11   Y 511001   82   306   AD4   75.00   10.00   N 512064   82   306   AD4   45.00   6.00   N © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  How to get the data to PowerFAIDS     After Payroll has been updated for FWS Students, what happens next?     From FAM – (Financial Aid Student Employment), you now run the Work Study Update from Payroll option:  •   Need to create a data (dat) file that can be loaded back into PowerFAIDS.  •   CAUTION!!! – Make sure that NO One is running any disbursements when you are going to do this! © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  How to get the data to PowerFAIDS © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  An error you may see...  If the POE ID is 0, that means that the data in the PA_WRK_STDY_EDIT table has a 0 POE ID. This is because the workstudy year and term on the payroll controls at the time the payroll was updated did not find a match on the POE Cross Reference table in Financial Aid. Fix: Your IT staff will need to edit the PA_WRK_STDY_EDIT table and update the rows where the POE_ID is zero with the actual POE ID it should have been. Payroll should also look at Payroll Controls and update the workstudy year and term so that the next payroll is correct. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  An error you may see...  If the POE ID is correct, this error typically means you forgot to run Anticipated Aid for the workstudy fund. Anticipated Aid is what creates the row in the Student Award table. Fix: Run Anticipated Aid for the POE in question and then re- run the Workstudy Update from Payroll option. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Student employment master in EX once a successful update has occurred  The amount paid and hours worked from payroll are automatically updated on the student employment master. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Go back into PowerFAIDS, Administration, Funds  •   Set the FWS fund flag to now be Disbursable. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     PowerFAIDS Student – Tools – Data Integration – Import Data – External Disbursement  •   Choose File and run as Simulation to verify...     Run using SSN and the AS of Date – typically today’s date...  •   When satisfied that no errors exist, re-run as Real  •   REMEMBER, to go back into PowerFAIDS Administration and REMOVE the check box on disbursable for the workstudy fund. Otherwise, you will have problems when you run your next disbursement, at least out of PowerFAIDS. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     PowerFAIDS Student – Tools – Data Integration – Import Data – External Disbursement  •   When satisfied that no errors exist, re-run as Real  •   REMEMBER, to go back into PowerFAIDS Administration and REMOVE the check box on disbursable for the FWS Fund. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.
