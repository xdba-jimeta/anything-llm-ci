During this course, you will learn how to manage and verify your transactions, enable a more efficient invoice management, and optimize daily cash flow that will help you maintain strong vendor relationships. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  7  Chapter 3.   U NDERSTANDING   A CCOUNTS   P AYABLE  This chapter will provide an overview of the features and functionality that are available in the Accounts Payable module.  O BJECTIVES     Understand the tasks that are performed by an associate     Understand the tasks that are performed by an administrator     Use the checklists to keep track of the sub-tasks identified for each activity  O VERVIEW  The Accounts Payable module will provide several resources to manage the cash outflow for your institution.  You can track your vendor and invoice information by assigning a subsidiary to each vendor. A subsidiary is a group of individual balances that are associated with a particular General Ledger (control) account. The sum of all subsidiaries will equal the balance of the control account; therefore, you will need to identify these General Ledger accounts with a subsidiary code.  As with all EX modu les, vendor information must first exist on the Name and Address  Master before it can be identified in other master tables such as Vendor Master and  AP Master.  Keep in mind the distinct difference between the Subsidiary Definition, Subsidiary Group, and Check Prefix and how they are utilized within the Accounts Payable module.  Subsidiary  Definition  Assigned to venders (also  referred to as Subsidiary  Code)  Controls which SBS and  Cash accounts are used to  create DB entries  Subsidiary  Group  Allows you to group  subsidiary definitions  Check Prefix  Identifies the bank account  number from which checks  will be issued  Tracks the check series and  determines the next  available check number  Used in the check  reconciliation function EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   8  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  I DENTIFYING THE   W ORKFLOW FOR AN   AP   A SSOCIATE  In most cases, an AP associate will be responsible for several activities:     creating   invoices for payment     generating checks     reconciling the bank account     managing vendor records     filing gover nment forms  Your particular institution may identify one or more individuals to perform these duties and their  respective tasks that are identified on the checklists below.  Creating Invo ices for Payment  Invoices can be received directly from a vendor, through a regularly scheduled vendor payment, or from student refunds. When an invoice is received, you may want to review its contents, match it up with a respective purchase order, and verify that the goods have been received.  Enter a vendor  invoice  The most common method for initiating payment to a vendor is to enter an invoice directly into the system.  Typical vendor terms can be identified on the vendor profile so that future invoices will be easy to create.  Create an invoice  from scheduled  payments  You may have established regular relationships with vendors that provide consistent products or services on a regular basis.  In this case, your administrator can identify a regularly scheduled payment so that invoices are automatically created when the process runs.  Generate invoices  for student refunds  When a course is dropped that has already been paid, a credit balance will appear on the student's Accounts Receivable account.  Since the EX modules are integrated, an invoice can be created in Accounts Payable so that a refund can be issued.  Create credit memos  against an invoice  In some cases (such as an incomplete order or damaged goods), a vendor may issue a credit memo against an invoice.  You will therefore want to match the credit memo with its respective invoice and reduce the amount that is due to the vendor. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  9  Generating Checks  When a check is generated, funds are released from your institution   –   this will occur when providing refunds to students or paying for goods and services. Before the check is generated, however, you will want to perform several steps so that your upcoming cash outflow does not exceed your available cash balances.  Match Check to  Invoice, Invoice to  Purchase Order, and  Purchase Order to  Requisition  Within the disbursement cycle, several components are related and issued in a specific sequential order. Initially, a requisition is created followed by a purchase order; the invoice is received and finally a check is generated to pay for the goods or services.  For accounting purposes, it is critical to view all of the related components before actually making the payment.  Review upcoming  cash outflows  Before checks are issued, you will want to view the amount of the check run to be sure that your cash balance is sufficient.  Therefore, you can run a report that lists expected cash outflows (invoices due) by day to determine when checks can be generated.  Select invoices   Once you have determined that the checks can be generated, you will need to select the invoices to be paid.  Modify address and  due date  If the default vendor address that has already been assigned to the invoice needs to change, you can simply override the vendor address since the invoice has already been posted.  By changing the due date of an invoice, you can remove it from the check run which will impact the cash outflow.  Print checks or  generate ACH  electronic payments  After the invoices are selected, you can print checks   – you may want to review them before approving and accepting the check run.  Print a single  immediate check  When paying one specific invoice, you may want to print one single check immediately.  Enter a single  manual check  There may be rare situations when a blank manual check, written outside of the system, needs to be generated.  Although this practice is not recommended, you can do so and then enter the manual check back into the system once the receipt or check stub is returned to the Accounts Payable office. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   10  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  Reconciling the Bank Statement  The reconciliation between your book and bank balances is critical in managing finances at your institution.  Reconcile checking  accounts  Checks are received and deposited into the vendor's bank which is then routed to the institution's bank for payment.  The timing of checks and deposits clearing the bank and being recorded on your books will vary. Therefore, reconciliation needs to be performed for each bank account on a monthly basis to be sure that both records are in sync. When discrepancies are found (such as lost checks, recording errors, and even fraudulent activity), they need to be researched and corrected.  Review issued  checks  After checks have been issued and reconciled, you may still find it necessary to view one or more checks and their specific details for auditing purposes.  Void   checks   A check may need to be voided if it does not clear after several months or is damaged during the printing process.  Remember that voiding a check is not the same a deleting a check   – a check that has been voided remains in the system indicating that no funds left the bank when it was issued.  Delete cleared  checks  You may find it necessary to delete very old checks in order to improve performance issues encountered when reconciling checking accounts.  Do not delete checks if they are less than 5 years old and only when performance is a significant problem since losing an audit trail of check is not a recommended practice.  Managing Vendor Records  Proper vendor management will assist in efficiently processing invoices and cash disbursements.  Create or update  vendor profiles  Before an invoice can be issued, the vendor must exist in the EX system.  You can establish certain defaults (such as shipping terms and account numbers) in each vendor profile so that invoice entry will be easier.  Review financial  activity with vendors  To efficiently manage relationships with vendors, you will want to be able to quickly review their financial activity.  This can be accomplished by viewing specific transaction details or all transactions within a batch. You can also use customizable reports for a quick snapshot or overview of the activity. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  11  Clear vendor totals   In order to track vendor activity in a new year, the old balances need to be  cleared and placed in a prior year storage area.  Recommended practice is to perform this process during a   year - end   close.  Review invoices to  be paid by vendor  Use this report to view a list of vendors along with the invoices that need to  be paid as well as when they are to be paid for the amount of   money that is  due for each vendor.  Review vendor AP  aging report  Due to possible issues with the delivery of goods or cash flow shortages,  invoices can begin to age.  You can generate the aging report to see the vendors for which invoices  are past   due. This information is also useful for auditors in order to  determine if any financial problems exist at your institution or if any  payables need to be written off because they are in dispute and will never  be paid.  Filing Government Forms  Vendors who are not incorporated will need to report income received to the federal government on a 1099 form. Several forms are supported with the EX software   –   specifically, 1099Int, 1099Misc, 1099Q, and 1099R. Transactions can be identified to appear within any boxes on these supported forms and will automatically be totaled at the end of the year to be printed on the correct form.  Review 1099 totals   Before actually filing your 1099s with the government, you may find it helpful to view a report of all vendor activity for the calendar year.  This process may help you find possible vendors that have not been identified to receive a 1099 and can also locate transactions that should not be filed.  File 1099 forms   At the end of each calendar year, you will need to report specific vendor activity to the federal government.  In addition to filing the forms, you can also print a summary report of all 1099 information that is about to be submitted and electronically file the proper form. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   12  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  I DENTIFYING THE   W ORKFLOW FOR AN   AP   A DMINISTRATOR  There are several settings available in the Accounts Payable module that will allow you to  customize the behavior of the software to fit your specific needs. An AP Administrator   can be  granted access to these settings or you may choose to assign tasks to individuals that use the  core processes on which they have an effect.  Adjust general  settings  You can determine the type of budget check that is performed for invoices including:     the creation of warnings or errors when an invoice will negatively impact the budget     define tax percentages to be used for refunds     activate automatic payable date calculations for vendors with pay terms defined     allow credit memos to be created  Designate GL  accounts as  subsidiary ledgers  Specific General Ledger accounts are used to track both accounts receivable and accounts payable balances.  These accounts must be totaled as a subsidiary ledger. While an accounts payable subsidiary will hold all invoices that are charged against it, the accounts receivable subsidiary will hold student accounts.  Defining the accounts that are a subsidiary (either accounts payable or accounts receivable) and the cash accounts with which they are associated is necessary before using the Accounts Payable module.  Combine  subsidiaries  In some cases, you may find it helpful to combine several subsidiaries into one larger subsidiary group.  Define aging report   Create as many as 6 buckets that will be displayed on the aging report by defining the maximum overdue days and column description for each bucket.  Associate GL  account with bank  account  When checks are generated, the cash that is disbursed will be taken from a bank account and must also be deducted from a General Ledger cash account number.  The General Ledger accounts that are associated with each bank account need to be established before checks can be generated.  Enter checks from a  previous system  You may have checks that were written outside of the EX Accounts Payable module that need to be entered into the system. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  13  Schedule automatic  payments  When the same invoice occurs on a monthly basis (such as landscaping  services), you can set up a scheduled regular payment that will  automatically create the invoice.  More than one regular payment can be created for each vendor by  associating it with th e proper subsidiary, identifying the payment amount,  and defining the date range or months when the payments will be made.  Establish tax refund  groups  When invoices are created, the sales or other local taxes that have been  applied on the invoice may be refundable to the institution.  You can define an unlimited number of tax refund groups which can then  be assigned to invoices and, when posted, the ta x refunds will  automatically be calculated and accepted as a receivable item.  T HE   B IG   P ICTURE  The Business Office suite of products is very tightly integrated and supports a single source of data entry. In the context of this learning guide, the desired result is to pay a vendor for goods or services that have been provided.  There are several steps that need to be performed in order to keep an organized and detailed audit trail of this type of information. As displayed in the diagram below, the first two steps are performed in the Purchasing module whereas the last two steps are performed in the Accounts Payable module.  Step 1:  a requisition is  entered  Step 2:  a purchase  order is created  Step 3:  an invoice is  generated  Step 4:  a payment is  made EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   14  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  You can also view this integration by tracking an item through all four steps by accessing the   Matching Requisition, PO, Invoice and Check   window.  In this case, the   Select for Inquiry   tab was selected. On the left side of the window, you can choose any of the numbers to be used as your search criteria by using the drop down menu and the right side of the window will display the tracking information.  Using the same four steps illustrated above, you will be able to view the progress of this particular requisition number as follows:     Step 1: Requisition number 181 was entered into the system     Step 2: Purchase order number 968 was created from the requisition     Step 3: Invoice number 783IV329 was generated against the purchase order     Step 4: Payment was made through the AP subsidiary with check number 1000 EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  15  1   Select any of the numbers displayed on the right side of the window and click the  View   button  o   Depending on the item that is selected, you will be able to view its respective entry window in display mode   –   in this example, the invoice number was selected:  2   The   Invoices   window will be displayed and you will be able to view specific details related to this invoice   –   specifically, source code, group number, transaction date, subsidiary code, invoice amount, and payee  You can easily view any type of related detail on the item from the   Purchasing A/P Inquiry   window.  The   Transactions   tab will only be accessible through the following path:  3   Go to   Vendor Inquiry  4   Enter a vendor ID number (for illustration purposes, we will use the same vendor for this invoice which is 783)  5   Click   OK EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   16  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  6   Select an invoice and choose the   Purchasing A/P Inquiry   right-click option  7   The   Transaction   tab will be active and you will be able to view the source code, group number, transaction amount and date on the transaction  8   The right side of the window will behave the same way on both the   Transaction   and the   Select for Inquiry   tab  o   Select any of the numbers displayed on the right side of the window and click the   View  button EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  17  Chapter 4.   C ONFIGURING   A CCOUNTS   P AYABLE  This chapter will provide details on accessing Accounts Payable and explain the set up and configuration options that are available for the module.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand the configurable components of the module     Perform the configuration to achieve the results you desire  P ERMISSIONS  As with all other EX modules, you will need to assign the appropriate group permissions in the Tasklist module for specific functions that exist in Accounts Payable.  On the   Group Definition window, select the group     Click on the   Membership button to add members or click on the  Permissions button to assign permissions to the group   – for the purpose of this illustration, the  Permissions button is selected     If you need to create a new group, right-click and choose the  Add Row option  Click the   Functions tab and notice the two panels  – all of the functions that are assigned to the group will be displayed in the left panel ( Allowed) and all of the functions that are not assigned to the group will be displayed in the right panel ( Not Allowed). Click on a function from the right panel and use the arrow to move it into the left panel. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   18  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  G ENERAL   C ONFIGURATION  You can choose four settings that will affect the manner in  which your Accounts Payable module functions.  Go to the   A / P Configuration   window.  You can choose to display a Warning, Error message, or neither when insufficient funds prevent  an invoice from being generated.  Select the   Grant Refunds   checkbox to track tax refunds and create disbursement transactions to  the tax refund account. You   can then indicate the amount of tax that vendors add to invoices for  which you will claim a refund or rebate (Tax Refund %) and the amount of tax that vendors add to  invoices for which you do not claim a refund or rebate (Tax to Exclude %).  You may wish to have the system calculate and display the   Invoice Payable Date   based on  terms such as discount percent, discount days, net days, and the current date that have been  established in the Accounts Payable Master table.  Therefore, if this check box is selected, the following conditions will apply to a 2%, 10 days, net 30  vendor with the following two scenarios:  Figure   1 : Terms 2/10/30 if today's date is less than or equal to invoice date  Figure   2 : Terms 2/10/30 if today's date is greater than or equal to invoice date  You can choose to display the   Credit Memo   window after an invoice with a negative amount is  created and saved. Even if this checkbox is not selected, y ou will still be able to create a process  a credit memo against the next open invoice for the vendor; however, you will not be able to  attach it to a specific invoice transaction. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  19  D EFINING   S UBSIDIARIES  A subsidiary identifies the accounts payable (SBS) and cash accounts that will be used to create DB entries. When the DB is posted, these entries will be reflected on the General Ledger.  While the total of one or more transactions is contained within the control account in the general ledger, the detail and summary of each appears in the subsidiary accounts.  You can define subsidiaries in Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable   –   once a subsidiary exists in one module, it will be available in both modules. An Accounts Payable subsidiary can track the detailed transactions and total amount that is owed to each vendor while an Accounts Receivable subsidiary tracks every kind of transaction except those that fall into the Accounts Payable category such as deferred income or liability accounts.  In order for the SB transactions to post to the desired Cash account, you need to create a separate subsidiary using the same general ledger account specified for the SB prefix. In this case, you may also need to designate a unique AP account.  Subsidiaries are also assigned to vendors where it is referred to as a Subsidiary Code.  1   Go to the   Setup A/P & A/R Subsidiary Definitions   window and enter a two-digit code and description for the subsidiary as illustrated below:  Select the account number to which transactions will be applied   – this is also the General Ledger control account for the subsidiary being defined  Select the cash account to which offsetting transactions will be applied   – you can identify only one cash account for each subsidiary  Select this checkbox to identify an Accounts Payable subsidiary  Since subsidiary balances on reports will print according to subsidiary codes, you may  want to create codes according to the order in which the balances are to appear on  student statements. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   20  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  You may also define a group of subsidiaries consisting of one or all of your control accounts.  In this case, you may create a group of RG for regular payments and issue checks or generate reports for all subsidiaries that belong to the RG group at the same time.  2   Go   to the   Subsidiary Group   Control   window  3   After your groups have been created, you can  determine the subsidiary accounts that will be  associated with a group by right - clicking on  the row in the   Subsidiary Group Control   window  and selecting the   Subsidiary Group Control  Relationship   option  4   Using the   Add   and   Remove   buttons, move subsidiaries to the right pane of this window to include them in the group  In the example shown above, the AP (Accounts Payable) and FM (Facilities Management) subsidiary codes have been included in the RG (Regular Payments) subsidiary group. You can then select subsidiary groups that need to be captured for the check run on the   Checks to be Issued   report so that all invoices assigned to the subsidiaries in the group will be included in the report. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  21  Use caution in grouping when you select the   Payment Prefix   on the   Checks to be Issued   report to obtain the starting check number and the bank account against which the checks will be drawn, since the combination of Subsidiary Group and Payment Prefix can result in printing checks that will be drawn on an incorrect bank account.  You may group subsidiaries using the same Cash accoun t assuming you have a one -  to - one relationship   –   that is, one unique Cash account number for each unique bank  account number.  S ELECTING   D EFAULTS FOR   A GING   R EPORT  You may want to be view upcoming cash flows to determine how timely your vendors can be paid. This can be done through an aging report, which provides a snapshot of your unpaid invoices   –   both current and past due   –   on any given day.  The Accounts Payable module allows you to establish defaults that will be used whenever the aging report is created.  1   Go to the   Aging Report   Configuration   window  2   Select a default subsidiary group that will be  used most often for your aging report data  3   Define as many as six aging periods as  illustrated to the left  The column description will appear as headers on the report.

While vendors can have more than one electronic payment record, the dates for each  record cann ot overlap each other.  Vendors generally issue credit memos rather than refund checks to their customers. However, on occasion, you may receive a refund check from a vendor.  Vendor refund checks should be recorded in the system using a Refund Invoice   –   in this way, the invoice will correct the total amounts paid to the vendor. If you use a feature in another Business Office module (such as the A/R Receipting function), the vendor totals will no longer be correct in the A/P Master table.

Credit memos (that is, invoices with debit amounts) will be applied against the oldest invoices. Therefore, any debit balances need to be applied against credit amounts, starting with the oldest, until there is no remaining debit balance.  If a debit balance remains (that is, the credit memos are greater than the total of outstanding invoices), the remaining balance will be applied to the first aging period.

The date you enter on the  Checks/Electronic Payments To Be  Issued Report   window is actually the  date that will appear on the printed check  as the issue date.   The current date will  automatically default into this field;  however, you can change as necessary.  Scenario A  Using the two illustrations above, if you would like to print checks on 12/28/2008 for all invoices that are payable up through and including 12/31/2008, do the following:  1   Enter 3/19/2012 in the   Invoices Scheduled to be Paid on or Before   field on the   Select Invoices for Payment   window  2   Enter 3/19/2012 in the   Date to be on Check   field on the   Checks To Be Issued Report  window  If you receive a message that no invoices have been found, this indicates that no eligible invoices are payable on or before 12/31/2008 due to one of the following reasons:     All eligible invoices were paid in a previous check run     Un-posted invoices may exist   –   therefore, post the relevant IV groups, then run the Checks To Be Issued Report so that invoices meeting the eligibility criteria will now be captured in the report EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   54  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  I NTERNAL   P ROCESS  When you generate the Checks to Be Issued report, the following series of events will occur:  1   Any invoices that have already been assigned a check number will be cleared  2   The invoice transactions that need to be paid will be retrieved from the report query  3   The subsidiary group will be validated  4   The total for each vendor is   calculated  5   The number of checks to be issued is counted and incremented to next available  check number  o   If a check net amount is $0, it will be displayed in the Checks To Be Issue Report with the check number of zero and the check register will ignore this check  6   Invoice transactions will be sorted  7   Report is generated  8   Invoices that have been paid will be flagged and identified by the check number that  has been issued to it  M AKING   C REDIT   C ARD   P AYMENTS TO   V ENDORS  You may have a situation where invoices to vendors need to be paid by credit cards. In this situation, the best recommendation is to keep credit card and check transactions completely separated by creating a parallel structure.  The steps below can be used as a guideline for the credit card structure. For the purpose of this illustration, the CC (Credit Card) code will be used as an example.  1   Create a new CC Subsidiary Group  2   Create a new CC Subsidiary Definition  3   Create a new CC Check Prefix  4   Group the Subsidiary Definition beneath the Subsidiary Group  5   Add the Subsidiary Definition to every vendor record that is to be paid by credit card (referred to as the Subsidiary Code on the Vendor window)  6   Enter invoices and select the CC Subsidiary Code  7   When generating the Checks To Be Issued Report, select the CC Subsidiary Group and   the CC Check Prefix EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  55  8   Produce dummy checks to pay these invoices by inserting blank paper into the printer and generating the Check Register  9   Respond to the prompt that the checks have printed successfully and post the DB group as usual  When performing Steps 1 through 3, you will need to decide whether to use your existing bank account number, GL cash account and GL payable account, or create new accounts on the general ledger.  Remember that the Checks   To Be Issued Report will be tagging invoices based  on the Subsidiary Group   –   not the Subsidiary Code. Therefore, if you were to  classify the AP and CC Subsidiary Codes under the single AP Subsidiary Group,  the two categories of invoices will be combined o n the CTBI Report. By  establishing a parallel structure of the CC Subsidiary Group and CC Subsidiary  Code, you can be sure that credit card transactions are isolated from those  invoices that must be paid by check.  V OIDING   P AYMENTS AND   C HECKS  After a check has already been issued, you may find the need to void the payment due because of incorrect data or because the vendor was paid more than once for the same item.  A Note will be used to identify specific information related to the text preceding it   and  will be recognized by this type of format and icon.  A void check invoice will allow you to identify and reverse all of the detail rows within the transaction.

If a check needs to be voided that was written outside of the system, you will need to access the   Adjust Previous System Checks/Epayments  window.  8   Enter search criteria in the top portion of the window to locate the check  9   When the appropriate check information is displayed in the bottom portion of the window, enter a   Return/Void Date   and select the   Void Flag   checkbox EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  57  Reversing a Voided Check  You may have determined that a check was voided in error after it has already cleared. In this case, you will need to reverse the void and correct the check reconciliation details.  Scenario A  If the VD group was not posted and all checks in the group were voided in error:     Delete the VD group which will reverse all void records from the transaction history table for all checks in the group and removes the void date and void flag from the check reconciliation table  Scenario B  If the VD group was posted and all checks in the group were voided in error:     Reset the group status back to U (unposted)     Delete the VD group which will reverse all void records from the transaction history table for all checks in the group and removes the void date and void flag from the check reconciliation table  Scenario C  If the VD group was posted with a mixture of valid voids and invalid voids:     When the majority is valid, keep the posted VD group and correct the trans_hist and chk_reconciliation tables for the specific checks that were voided in error  o   In this case, a GL recalc must be performed as the final step     When the majority is invalid, void the group, re-enter voids for the checks that should be voided using Scenario B, and re-enter and post the valid voids EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   58  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  Chapter 8.

P ROCESSING AND   R EPORTING   G OVERNMENT   F ORMS  This chapter will guide you through all six steps of the Government Forms Filing Wizard that is used to generate the required 1099 forms.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Successfully utilize the feature available in the Accounts Payable module to identify and report the amount paid for goods or services to the Federal Government for tax purposes  I DENTIFYING   T RANSACTIONS  Scenario A  The recommended practice is to assign the 1099 eligibility forms to each vendor per subsidiary as you are creating the vendor. This will allow any invoice that is generated for the vendor/subsidiary to be assigned the appropriate 1099 form.  In the example shown here, every invoice created for Staples using the AP Subsidiary Code will automatically be assigned the 1099R Form for tax purposes.  Since the Government does not require any amounts less than $600 to be reported, the 1099R Form will not be created for Staples at the end of the year if the total amount of invoices did not exceed $600.  Scenario B  In some cases, either you or the vendor may want to generate a 1099 form at the end of the year regardless of the total amount of invoices and this can be done by using the Required Govt Forms tab on the Vendors window. Enter vendor ID number, click   Required Govt Forms   tab. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  63  In this example, John's Paper Supply will be issued both a 1099R and a 1099MISC form through the Government Forms Filing Wizard regardless of the total invoices amount.  1   Right click and select the   Add Row   option  2   Choose the   Government Form Code   that is to be associated with the vendor  3   To view the calendar year totals for a vendor, click the   Govt Form Totals   tab, select a year, and click   Retrieve .  Scenario C  If for some reason a vendor is not associated with any Government forms but a specific invoice is eligible for 1099 reporting, you can associate an individual item with the specific details related to the tax refund including the Government form and label. From the Invoices window, select an invoice, click the   Open  button, click the   Header   tab.  The   Tax Refund Code   must be configured. The codes that have been defined will appear in the drop down menu on this window and you can associate the appropriate code with a specific invoice.  Both the   Government Form Code   and   Government Label Codes   are provided through the software and will be updated on a regular basis as the Government makes the appropriate changes. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   64  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  U SING THE   F ORMS   F ILING   W IZARD  You can easily follow the steps that are displayed on each tab of the Government Forms Filing Wizard.  Step 1:   Select Form  1   Select the form and the calendar year for which the information is to be filed  o   As soon as you begin to enter data, the tab for the next step will become enabled  2   Click   Next EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  65  Customizing the Query  You may also customize the query that is being used to select only 1099 amounts for vendors that have been paid in excess of $600, which meets the minimum requirements for the IRS. Remember that the query will not recognize manual adjustments; therefore, if a manual adjustment was made for $100 and the query was customized to only select amounts in excess of $600, the manual adjustment will still be selected.  Click the   Customize button and click   OK to overwrite the report.  The setting selected on the Required Govt Forms tab of the Vendors window will  always override the query so that vendors may receive a form regardless of the  transaction amount.  The decision regarding the vendors who must receive the 1099 form regardless of the transaction amount is best made by the business office staff   –   therefore, you can always be sure that the setting selected on the Required Govt Forms tab will always be honored.  Scenario A     Staples has been identified with the 1099 Misc form on the Required Govt Forms tab     You have customized your query to only select vendors with more than $600 in transactions     John's Paper Supply does not have transactions exceeding $600  In this case, you can deselect the   Create Form   checkbox in Step 2 of the wizard and proceed to Step 5 where the vendor will be skipped during the form printing process.  Although you can also delete the form from the vendor record, this is not a recommended practice since you will need to add the row again if the vendor needs the form at another time. EX Accounts Payable Learning Guide   66  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v elo pm e nt  Step 2:   Review and Adjust Form Data  You can perform the following actions:     Review the form data for accuracy     Un-assign transactions from the form     View and modify the transaction details of a vendor record  When you select the   View Detail option, the   Government Forms  Box Details window will be displayed:  If you do not want to report a transaction or need to change the form and label codes, click the  Unclassify All button.  If you want to remove only the 1099 data for one of the rows, select it and use the backspace key to remove the data.  When you override an amount in any of the columns, the note will indicate that a manual adjustment was made. To remove the manual adjustment, right-click on the amount and select the   Clear Form Adjustment option.
