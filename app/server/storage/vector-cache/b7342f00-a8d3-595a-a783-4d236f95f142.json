For institutions which have been live with the module for some time, the process is used either for mass maintenance purposes, or because there has been a gap in module use. December 2015 2 Page  I.   THE GENERAL TAB  The   General   tab of the   Synchronize Advisee Information   window allows you to select a query to determine which students the process will update. The default <Original> query pulls IDs who have a row in the Student Term Summary table with year and term values that match the values identified in the   Current Year   and   Current Term   columns in the   Registration Configuration   window.  Many institutions must modify the query to accommodate their needs; for example, if they ’ ve only built trees for one catalog year, they may wish to modify the query to pull only current students who are under the catalog they ’ ve built trees for, rather than all current"}},{"id":"d474cbda-c74a-4e25-a7e9-105971a956b6","values":[-0.017239317297935486,0.06455516815185547,0.006800355389714241,0.10382908582687378,-0.053975678980350494,0.06331755220890045,0.0520450621843338,0.05771835893392563,-0.08068251609802246,0.025494078174233437,0.0329243429005146,-0.02906058169901371,0.08470109850168228,-0.12537863850593567,-0.09965929388999939,0.05939710512757301,0.012584217824041843,0.04909559711813927,-0.07000582665205002,-0.010975850746035576,-0.009958711452782154,0.05408826470375061,0.0698663592338562,-0.006992486771196127,0.014174746349453926,0.02307533659040928,-0.03756607696413994,0.03869638219475746,-0.050532978028059006,-0.00020414356549736112,-0.04322413355112076,0.04502270743250847,0.008870340883731842,0.1024118959903717,0.005379126872867346,-0.0600646436214447,0.010693999007344246,0.09581920504570007,0.07109470665454865,0.00509074330329895,-0.03718990460038185,-0.055507924407720566,0.015732547268271446,0.018706638365983963,-0.05987543240189552,-0.013396697118878365,-0.0842025876045227,-0.02574334293603897,-0.03397645801305771,0.10347521305084229,-0.18242189288139343,-0.04791887104511261,-0.09799336642026901,-0.06597960740327835,0.035459425300359726,0.047512318938970566,0.022224249318242073,-0.030483657494187355,-0.10381267219781876,-0.001555039780214429,0.0022390999365597963,-0.01944669894874096,0.009432018734514713,0.018117588013410568,-0.022368306294083595,-0.011836984194815159,0.0010918318293988705,0.018400151282548904,0.014381074346601963,0.02565489150583744,0.044567275792360306,0.020315973088145256,-0.017304837703704834,-0.0786748006939888,0.017290057614445686,0.10661245137453079,-0.07801779359579086,0.05563020333647728,0.019425299018621445,-0.09985529631376266,0.0029585380107164383,0.07857188582420349,-0.03042583353817463,0.0033866623416543007,0.030039291828870773,-0.11683742702007294,0.13230641186237335,-0.07307703793048859,0.09009376913309097,-0.061283186078071594,-0.011566530913114548,-0.09148316085338593,-0.03315482661128044,-0.01721370778977871,0.009997058659791946,-0.0006289923330768943,0.013252675533294678,-0.02930295653641224,0.1345810443162918,0.017739316448569298,-0.022998029366135597,0.04511028528213501,-0.0512082539498806,-0.04125968739390373,-0.15557584166526794,-0.08365200459957123,0.01163795217871666,-0.012545936740934849,-0.07447480410337448,0.01890328899025917,0.05447256192564964,0.014235572889447212,-0.06851986050605774,-0.12305066734552383,-0.019394341856241226,0.017157649621367455,-0.011356952600181103,0.04464768245816231,-0.016322799026966095,0.03048418089747429,0.02176215685904026,0.0872422456741333,-0.018781282007694244,0.03218073397874832,-0.06910422444343567,0.02121085301041603,-0.060385771095752716,2.7578247250702763e-33,0.05205811932682991,-0.0012794117210432887,0.00686268787831068,-0.03944873437285423,0.0006674921605736017,0.07687359303236008,-0.02126850187778473,0.04553148150444031,-0.04610922187566757,0.02315841056406498,0.03802671656012535,0.01201316062361002,0.001199222169816494,-0.03805151209235191,-0.09881098568439484,0.012213884852826595,-0.03701142966747284,0.06294059008359909,-0.045314885675907135,0.05224266275763512,0.1405598521232605,-0.053649235516786575,-0.00003840594945359044,0.02834087423980236,0.034394703805446625,0.05719009414315224,-0.021177571266889572,0.041282765567302704,0.00860606413334608,-0.022770045325160027,0.009883115999400616,-0.09807989746332169,0.009109812788665295,-0.054857540875673294,0.01721949316561222,-0.0012288927100598812,-0.0021262303926050663,-0.007976573891937733,0.0168327447026968,0.046685997396707535,0.01534552313387394,0.015894019976258278,0.02579180710017681,-0.040515024214982986,-0.02245401404798031,0.01058279536664486,-0.031844690442085266,-0.005705313757061958,0.05235360562801361,-0.03742287680506706,-0.010276746936142445,-0.07861192524433136,-0.054379649460315704,-0.022060809656977654,0.012471204623579979,-0.039804283529520035,-0.03350600600242615,0.04637270048260689,-0.03883099555969238,-0.05045236274600029,0.02402513474225998,0.010845594108104706,0.049326930195093155,-0.08753038942813873,0.03376048430800438,0.06231297552585602,0.06079603359103203,0.0713404193520546,0.10465081036090851,-0.0408884696662426,-0.03112618811428547,-0.0016764220781624317,0.008275292813777924,0.013538121245801449,0.029066571965813637,0.018398499116301537,-0.06323421746492386,-0.04380917549133301,-0.04736388474702835,0.007011377718299627,0.0125205647200346,-0.03375406190752983,-0.05939923971891403,0.01211611833423376,-0.03999608755111694,0.02801710180938244,-0.005180918145924807,0.035858578979969025,-0.0031796940602362156,0.0047262879088521,0.0956406220793724,0.00033633247949182987,-0.017915690317749977,0.030263308435678482,-0.04044729098677635,-5.4308235737333085e-33,0.0528876893222332,-0.057496581226587296,0.0412285216152668,-0.10164910554885864,0.04948066547513008,0.01591767929494381,-0.04733126610517502,0.019103102385997772,-0.022131936624646187,-0.011010033078491688,0.01753990538418293,-0.08774536848068237
