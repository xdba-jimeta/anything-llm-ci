GENEDBS (Bachelor of Science)  •   GENEDBM (Bachelor of Music)  •   GENEDAA (Associate of Arts)  •   GENEDAS (Associate of Science)  •   GENEDAAS (Associate of Arts with Subject Concentration) 1 1 ©

Separate Degree Pathways  Note the difference in Communications requirements  1 2 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     As we were trimming up the General Education Requirements, we couldn’t ignore the other sections of the tree...     Our Major/Minor and Concentration Root Considerations:  •   Are all required courses included?  •   Are there any necessary subgroups?  •   Are the hours or counts correctly set up?  •   If there is a maximum number of hours or counts, is “When Met, Load Courses Until Max” checked?  •   Is there a minimum grade requirement?
