Pharos 360)   for Staff, Faculty and Adjuncts.  Preconditions  The individual needing access to the Tiger Paw system must be entered into the Jenzabar ERP system .  This is the basic   Name Master record   within Jenzabar. There should be only one Name Master record  for any person. Avoiding duplicate entries is important.  Employees and administrative staff should understand the importance of the Jenzabar ID Number as it  relates to their access rights. All employees should know their Jenzabar ID Number and should supply  this number when requesting assistance with access rig hts.  INSTRUCTIONS  Enter the   required attribute   data into the Jenzabar System.  1.   Open Jenzabar and   log in.  2.   Open the “ Name Entity ”   window.  3.   Enter the ID Number of the employee into the   ID Number lookup.   See Figure 1. Alternatively, you  can search by Last Name, First Name.  Figure 1   –   Name Entity   wi ndow in Jenzabar with ID Number entered. Figure 2   –   Name Entity   w indow in Jenzabar with Last Name, First Name being entered.  4.   On the “Individual” tab, check to ensure that an RCC email address has been applied to the record.  A valid rcc.mass.edu email address must be entered or the individual will not be included in the  Tiger Paw data feed. If there is no email, or the email is   not an RCC email address, please enter the  person’s correct RCC email address. [Hint: You can look this up in Microsoft Outlook’s address  book.] See Figure 2a.  Figure 2 a   –   Individual tab   in Jenzabar with   email correctly entered .  5.   Go to the “Attributes” tab of the “Name Entity” window.   See Figure 3.  Figure   3   –   The “Attributes” tab of the   Name Entity   w indow . 6.   Right - click in the attributes list area of the   screen to bring up the Pup - Up menu. (In this case the  attributes area of the screen is blank because this individual has no attributes assigned to them.)  Select the “Add Row” menu item. See Figure 4.  Figure   4   –   Accessing the “Add Row” menu item.  A   new row will be added. See Figure 5.  Figure   5   –   The newly added attribute row.  7.   Select the appropriate attribute from the drop - down list in the new row.  a.   If the individual is a full time Faculty member select the FAC attribute code.  b.   If the individual is a full time Staff member select the STAFF attribute code.  c.   If the individual is an adjunct instructor select the ADJ attribute code.  In this instance we selected the STAFF attribute code. See Figure 6. Figure   6   –   The STAFF code is selected.  8.   Save the record by clicking on the   “ Save ”   button in the upper left of your Jenzabar screen. See  Figure 7.  Figure   7   –   The   “ Save ”   button.  This individual will now be added as a Tiger Paw user the next time the automated Tiger Paw  account creation job runs,   which is usually within 24 hours.  END OF WORK INSTRUCTIONS",
