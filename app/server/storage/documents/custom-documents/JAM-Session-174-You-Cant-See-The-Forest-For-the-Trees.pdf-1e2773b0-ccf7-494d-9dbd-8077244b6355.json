Presented by: Eugenia Johnson, Academic Services Associate;  Jasmin Brown, Associate Dean and Registrar  Methodist University, Fayetteville, North Carolina  May 29, 2015  Jenzabar’s Annual Meeting  May 27 - 30, 2015 Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center  Nashville, TN  Session 174: You Can’t See the Forest for the Trees © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     There were two separate kingdoms: the land of Academic Advising and the neighboring realm of the Registrars.     Then...     The Great Wizard “Jenzabar” melded the two kingdoms into one.     This is the story of how that happened.  Once Upon a Time...  Academic Advising  Registrars  2 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Our contract with Jenzabar included an initial build of our institutional requirement trees, but that was just the start of our magical journey...     Prior to Jenzabar, we operated a legacy system, which did not include an electronic advising component beyond the generation of student transcripts.  The Methodist University Experience:  3 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Enough with the Fantasy, Let’s Get to Work!  4 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Our first trees consisted of a very generalized version of degree program requirements.     Basic degree requirements were included in the requirement trees, but the nuances had to be added.     Let’s take a look at how we decided to tame our forest.  The Methodist University Experience:  5 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     All institutional trees must contain certain elements:  •   Root requirements (majors, minors, concentrations)  •   *FREE  •   #ADMN     After these basic elements are in place – the rest of the tree is determined by an institution’s degree requirements.  The Basics of Building Institutional Requirement Trees:  6 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     The branches of the tree are “grown” by adding courses, groups and other requirements as necessary to fulfill the specific degree requirements.     Just like with real trees, the institutional requirement trees need regular attention, such as pruning old requirements that are no longer valid, and fertilizing the trees by adding new requirements.  The Basics of Building Institutional Requirement Trees:  7 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     An initial challenge we faced was how to address the many degree paths that are available to our students.     Our first step was to consult with the MU academic catalogue to define separate degree requirements for all pathways.  Our Challenge: Multiple Sets of General Education Requirements: (BA, BS, BSN, BSW, BFA, BM, etc.)  8 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     After identifying the various sets of requirements, we set up a root requirement named GENED.     This root contained only the requirements that were common to all degree pathways.  9 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  The original GENED roots of the tree  The expanded view of a GENED root  1 0 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     After setting up the common requirements, we proceeded to set up root requirements for each separate degree pathway.     Specific requirements for each degree were included in:  •   GENEDBA (Bachelor of Arts)  •   GENEDBS (Bachelor of Science)  •   GENEDBM (Bachelor of Music)  •   GENEDAA (Associate of Arts)  •   GENEDAS (Associate of Science)  •   GENEDAAS (Associate of Arts with Subject Concentration) 1 1 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Separate Degree Pathways  Note the difference in Communications requirements  1 2 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     As we were trimming up the General Education Requirements, we couldn’t ignore the other sections of the tree...     Our Major/Minor and Concentration Root Considerations:  •   Are all required courses included?  •   Are there any necessary subgroups?  •   Are the hours or counts correctly set up?  •   If there is a maximum number of hours or counts, is “When Met, Load Courses Until Max” checked?  •   Is there a minimum grade requirement?  Major/Minor/Concentration Roots  1 3 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Major/Minor/Concentration Roots  1 4 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  •   For Academic Year 2014-15, all the separate cores were merged into a common core...  •   However, departments could still choose to continue to offer either a BS degree, a BA degree, or both.  •   We had NO idea that this decision would require so many changes!  We thought we were doing well, THEN  1 5 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  •   Summer of 2014:     New federal reporting requirements     National Student Clearinghouse Report     #ADMN     *Free (maximum allowable electives per major )  New Requirements = Common Problems  1 6 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  •   Set individual limits by major on the free elective bucket...   •   Further clarify the requirements in complicated degree programs...     •   Create a “User’s Guide” that is specific to the Institutional Requirement Trees at Methodist University. (Coming Summer 2015!)  Going forward... Opportunities!!  1 7 © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Questions or Comments??
