    "pageContent": "Work Instruction   RCC - HR - 000 2  Human Resources Employee Onboarding in Jenzabar  Version   1. 0  Created   10 /0 8 /20 20  PURPOSE  The purpose of   correctly entering employee data into Jenzabar is to ensure the smooth provisioning of  technology systems access for   all   Staff, Faculty and Adjuncts.   Every employee, regardless of their role,  must be entered into Jenzabar.  INSTRUCTIONS  Create or locate the Name Entity record for the employee being  onboarded.  Each employee must be entered into the Jenzabar system. But they need only be entered once. If the  employee is a former student, then they will already have a record in Jenzabar. Never create a second  record simply because the individual   has transitioned from student to   employee.  1.   Open Jenzabar and log in.  2.   Open the “Name Entity” window.  3.   In this example, we are using an individual known to already be in the system. Enter the Last Name  and First Name into the appropriate fields. See Figure 1 below.  Important: It appears that RCC has habitually created additional Name Entity records for new  employees without first checking to see if   a Name Entity record already exists. This practice is  unnecessary and is the cause of problems for many new employees. This work instruction will  teach the correct method for checking that a Name Entity does not already exist. If found, the  existing Nam e Entity record should be utilized.  Never create a new Name Entity record as a matter of convenience. It is the wrong thing to do.  Doing so will cause long - term issues for the individual as well as the support staff who must  constantly deal with reconciling the dual identities. 4.   Click the “Save” button at the upper left - hand corner of your Jenzabar screen.  5.   Clicking the “Save” button will execute a Name Search within the   Jenzabar system. If no potential  matches are found, the record is simply saved. If potential matches are found, they are presented  to you in a new window , the “Duplicate Name Search” window. In this case, there are 2 potential  matches. The first is ID Number 15205, with name “Delete, Delete”. This older record has a lower  ID Number and would have been the first record entered for this individual. Unfor tunately, a  second Name Entity was created at a later time, ID Number 65992.   So this is a perfect ex ample of a  second record being created when it should not have been.  Th e “Duplicate Name Search” window   has many features and is useful for reviewing the existing  Name Entity records to determine if there is a match already in the system. You may select a row as  shown   above and   click on the “More Detail” button. You may also check the “Address History” and  “Name History”. Checking the   Social Security Number   and birthdate   is the most definitive way to  perform the match. But the other methods are valid as well.  If any of the records returned by the “Duplicate Name Search” tool appear to be a match, then click  on the “Select Match” button. This prevents a new record from being created and returns you to  the Name Entity screen with the selected record being retrie ved. If you do not believe that any of the records returned by the “Duplicate Name Search” are matches,  then you may go forward with creating a new Name Entity record. Click on the “No Match   –   New  ID” button to create the new Name Entity record.  Enter the   additional   required   data into the Jenzabar System.  6.   With the “Name Entity” window open,   enter the individual’s email address on the “Individual” tab.  If they have an existing email address that you wish to save as an alternate email address, you may  do so on the “Addresses” tab.  7.   Go to Addresses tab, and review the list of addresses related to this individual. If necessary, right -  click on the screen and select “Add Row” to create a new address record using the “*EML” address  type. Enter the email address you wish to save and chec k the “Email” checkbox.  8.   Next,   enter the individual’s S ocial Security Number and Birth Date on the “Biograph” tab. This is  essential information that makes it possible to be certain of an individual’s identity in the future. It  also helps to prevent the creation of duplicate records in the future.  9.   Save the records by clicking on the “Save” button.  Enter the   Attributes   data into the Jenzabar System.  10.   With the Name Entity screen still open, g o to the   “Attributes” tab of the “Name Entity” window.   See  Figure 3.  Figure   3   –   The “Attributes” tab of the   Name Entity   w indow .  11.   Right - click in the attributes list area of the screen to bring up the Pup - Up menu. (In this case the  attributes area of the   screen is blank because this individual has no attributes assigned to them.)  Select the “Add Row” menu item. See Figure 4. Figure   4   –   Accessing the “Add Row” menu item.  A new row will be added. See Figure 5.  Figure   5   –   The newly added attribute row.  12.   Select the appropriate attribute from the drop - down list in the new row.  a.   If the individual is a full time Faculty member select the FAC attribute code.  b.   If the individual is a full time Staff member select the STAFF attribute code.  c.   If the individual is an adjunct instructor select the ADJ attribute code.  In this instance we selected the STAFF attribute code. See Figure 6.  Figure   6   –   The STAFF code is selected. 13.   Save the record by clicking on the   “ Save ”   button in the upper left of your Jenzabar screen. See  Figure 7.  Figure   7   –   The   “ Save ”   button.  By correctly identifying the employee type on this attributes screen, the individual will be correctly  provisioned with additional permissions such as:   1) Access to Tiger Paw, 2) Access to MyRCC, 3)  Inclusion in the Employee table so that they will be able to utilize the purchasing/requisition module  if the business office decides to open up access to them.  This completes the new employee onboarding steps in Jenzabar.  END OF WORK INSTRUCTIONS",
