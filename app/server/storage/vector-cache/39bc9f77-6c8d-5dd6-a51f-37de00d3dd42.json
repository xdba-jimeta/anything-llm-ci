For example, you may want to notify your advisors to allow them to start planning their advising appointments. You do not have to notify advisors in order to publish the cycle.  Once you start creating the advising cycle, it is considered draft and can be updated until it is published. This allows you to complete the wizard if you need to return and finish setting it up at a later time, or need to make updates based on feedback from colleagues before publishing it and making it available to advisors.

The   Select people to share with   window appears.  2.   Enter and select the names of the J1 Web users with whom you want to share the calendar for review.  Sharing with department heads can facilitate collaboration and help avoid scheduling conflicts.  3.   Click   Update calendar access . Several things happen:  •   The advising cycle is now in a shared status. It can be updated and published, but it cannot return to a draft status. This means the cycle dates and associated year/term/sub-term and tel web group cannot be changed.  •   The J1 Web users you selected receive a message letting them know the calendar is ready for review. They can review the advising cycle and reply to the message with their recommendations for when the milestones occur, but they cannot update the advising cycle directly.

Automated tasks and messages can be associated to milestones as reminders of pending deadlines. There are three types of milestones:  •   Core Milestones   such as when the cycle begins and ends are required. Tasks and/or messages are automatically associated with these milestones.  •   Advisee Meetings   milestones determine when advisors are responsible for setting up their availability and meeting with advisees, and when advisees will be able to select available advising appointments. Advisors will automatically receive tasks and/or messages for these milestones.  •   Created by you   milestones are custom milestones such as meeting with an advisee's peer mentor or an advising cycle retrospective. You can create as many milestones as you want and they can be used in other advising cycles you can choose to use them or not.  Why are only certain years/terms/sub-terms available?  There are two reasons a year/term or sub-term might not be
