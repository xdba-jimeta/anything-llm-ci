This means the  student has a seat in the class.

Managing Registration using Course Limits and Web Groups  7/27/2024   Page   10  The Registration Office will need to collaborate with the person(s) in your institution that set up charges in  the Accounts Receivable module of EX. You will need to come up with your course charges scenarios and  determine the columns you need/wish to use to correctly generate course based charges for your Must Pay  courses.  One caution is that the definition of other charges may need to be changed to exclude Must Pay  courses.  Define the Fee Code in the Charges Definition/Charges Detail Entry window (AR, Admin, Task, Configure  Accounts Receivable, Charges).  The Table Code is SECTION_MASTER_V.  The Column Codes are the columns in which we entered values in the  Courses window: TUITION_CDE, UDEF_5_2_1.
