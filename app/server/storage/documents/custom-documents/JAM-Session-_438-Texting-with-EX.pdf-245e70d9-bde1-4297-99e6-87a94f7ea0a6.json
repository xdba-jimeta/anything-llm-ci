Why You Should Communicate Via Text  *** Statistics gathered from a 2014 US Survey report conducted by The Harris Poll on behalf of OneReach in August 2014. More details can be found at http://onereachcontactcenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/High-Demand-for-Customer-Service-via-Text-Message-2014-Report.pdf © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Notify candidates when their application or other documents have been received     Notify candidates when they’ve been accepted     Reminders regarding registration dates for select groups of students     Advertise campus events     Encourage students with balances to make payment arrangements     Financial aid deadline reminders  How You Could Use Texting in EX © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     A product of the creation of multiple (and potentially large numbers of) documents from a single template form and a structured data source.     The communication may be sent out to many \"recipients\" with small changes, such as a change of address or a change in the greeting line. MS Word Mail Merge allows a user to send letters or documents to many people simultaneously; users simply create one document that contains the information that will be the same in each version, and then add placeholders for the information that will be unique to each version.  What is a Merge Document? © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     You can use three types of merge documents to initiate the flow of communication within EX:  How are Merge Documents Used in EX? © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     The text is sent as an email merge document type to the mobile device.     Each cell carrier has a domain to which you can send text messages as an email. For example, for Sprint, the domain is “@messaging.sprintpcs.com”.     To send an text message, you would concatenate the phone number with the domain. For example, to send a message to a Sprint customer, the “To:” in the email might read  9105555555@messaging.sprintpcs.com .  The Text is Actually an Email! © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Mobile phone number     Cell carrier for the mobile phone number     Domains for all cell carriers     Text Opt-In  Data Elements © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Data Elements: Mobile Phone © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Data Elements: Text Opt-In and Cell Carrier © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Populating the Cell Carrier Drop Down List     Create a new column name “cell_carrier” © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Add records for each cell carrier with the name of the carrier in Alternate Value 1 and an “@” plus the domain of the carrier  Populating the Cell Carrier Drop Down List © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Mobile phone, cell carrier, and text opt-in are gathered using three methods:  •   By candidates in our CFNC online application. The import utility maps these questions to the fields.  •   By candidates in our myMU (JICS) online application. The form builder mapping tools are used to direct the data into the fields.  •   By students through a form builder form on myMU. Students can also go to this form to opt-out of University text messaging if they wish.
