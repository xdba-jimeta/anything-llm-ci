June 3, 2016  #1642   –   Student Registrations Based Upon   Ex i   Academic Planning © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  EX Ecosystem  EX/EX i  JICS     The EX Ecosystem  •   EX/ EXi   are still the main cog that drives the rest of the ecosystem. EXi continues to be developed as a true CRM environment for all of your internal constituents. It is quickly becoming the “go-to” tool for Advisors, Events Managers, Employees, Faculty, Registration Staff, and Student Affairs.  •   JICS   defines the main access point for all of your external constituents such as candidates, students, alumni, donors, and other external members of your community.  •   Jenzabar   Mobile Web   provides mobile access for students and faculty. We now have a new product,  Jenzabar   Native App , that provides key mobile device capabilities such as accessing the camera (for scanning), gives schools a marketing presence on iTunes or Google Play and allows us to pull in functionality from JICS & EXi when needed in a true native app environment. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     Goals  •   For Schools to set the most preferred patterns for students to take classes and successfully navigate their programs.  •   To have student Academic Plans be “enforced” during the online registration process.  •   Give you flexibility in managing different levels of adherence to plans that you need to lock certain students down tightly (1   st   semester Freshmen), or simply make their plan a suggestion and let them do their thing (Seniors, Honors students, etc.).  •   Create a new “Playground” experience for students to look around at possibilities and to assemble a potential schedule well in advance of their actual Registration time.  •   To provide students with a weekly calendar view of how their course schedule will look and to anticipate registration errors such as “Time Conflicts,” “Pre-Req/Co-Req,” “Waitlist,” etc... © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     How   EXi   & JICS Come Together  •   The “Sandbox” was created with EXi technology, but resides in JICS and can only be accessed in JICS by students.     Students cannot access EXi, and Advisors cannot access the Registration Tool. The two environments are completely separate.  •   The tool is installed by the same process that now delivers Portlets & CRMs to JICS (it’s called the WAS). So there’s nothing separate for you to worry about.  •   Speculation is that at some point Lois Ann may rebuild the exact interface within JICS. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.

June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     The Role EX Plays in the Process  •   It all starts with Year/Term/ Subterm   –   Year/Term Control for Web Registration  Groups © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     The Role EX Plays in the Process  •   Year/Term/ Subterm   –   Year/Term Control for Web Registration Groups is like a simple machine  that requires you to set, adjust, and test to get exactly the outcomes your looking for  •   The key columns:     Web Groups     Registration Clearance     Registration Approval     Plan Sensitivity  •   You can lock a student down very tightly, or give them free reign over the course selection     1 st   Semester New Students (or students on Probation II) might require Clearance, Approval, and be set to  the most restrictive Plan Sensitivity.     Seniors, or Honors students might not require any Clearance or Approval touch, and be in Web Groups  that have a very relaxed Plan Sensitivity.     Everyone else might find themselves somewhere in the middle.  •   The key is that you have the control, by Year & Term, By Web Group to leverage control over  how much flexibility a student has when it comes to registering for their courses © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     Setting up   EXi  •   To utilize the Registration by Plans functionality, make sure both the Academic Planning and Register by Plan settings are set to “On”  •   Make sure your students have Academic Plans attached to them  •   Advisors need to make sure that the student’s plans have been set in working with each student © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     Setting up   EXi  •   As a side note, not only does the Section Planning Confidence block provide great insight into planning your upcoming sections – it also helps identify where your Advisors & Students are in regards to setting up their terms for online registration © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     Navigation in JICS  •   If you’re NOT using Academic Planning, online registration, and all of the navigation for students will remain exactly as it is now  •   If you ARE using Academic Planning the system will automatically determine which location a student is directed to, based upon whether or not the student has a Plan © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     How it Works...  •   Once the student clicks on the “Register by Plan” link, it takes them to the new “sandbox” environment  •   The system uses the Tree Nodes to help determine what specific courses make up the elective choices that were not specifically accounted for in the Default Plan © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     How it Works...  •   Once the student clicks on the “Register by Plan” link it takes them to the new “sandbox” environment  •   The system uses the Tree Nodes to help determine what specific courses make up the elective choices that were not specifically accounted for in the Default Plan  •   Students are always easily able to manage and review details about each section © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     How it Works in   EXi  •   Designed as “mobile first” user story. Works well for students on their phones.  •   Students can easily move between the calendar view, and the plan listing/course search areas. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     Lets take a look at some of the visual language  •   Indicates to the student that the section they are looking at is not currently on their calendar  •   Means that the section they are looking at IS currently on their calendar – but no formal registration attempt has been made at this time.  •   Indicates to the student that Approval has already been requested for the course they are looking at and is Pending. (Section goes into a “Reserved” status)  •   If your institution utilizes Must Pay Courses, then this informs the student that the section they have selected must be paid in full before it will shift to the “Current” status.  •   Indicates to the student that Approval has already been requested for the course they are looking at and the Advisor has denied the course.  •   Means that the section the student is looking at has been fully registered for and the status is “Current”. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     Registration errors are protected  •   There are 36 different registration errors checked each time a student pulls the trigger on formally registering for classes. Every one of them is checked in the new Sandbox process as well.  •   We’ve tried to split out when the checking happens to help make the student’s experience cleaner and faster all around from a performance perspective.  •   User Experience should also cut down on the need to process certain errors at registration     Time Conflicts     Part-Time/Full-Time     Term Overload     Pre-Requisite Checking     Co-Requisite Checking © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Students Registrations Based Upon EX i   Academic Planning     Co - Requisite Swap Process  •   Student is notified immediately when they have placed a course in their sandbox that has a corequisite section that needs to be added as well.     Student even has access to a swap feature that will allow them to move co-requisite sections in and out of the sandbox to make sure things fit perfectly in their schedule.     Registering for   Subterm   Courses  •   Subterm courses are highlighted with stripes to make sure the student knows they are subterm sections, and not time conflict errors (even though they may overlap on the calendar).     Must Pay Courses  •   Must Pay Courses are still an important part of the registration story for many of you and the new online registration process notifies the student that a section(s) is must pay. Once they exit out of the sandbox and return to classic JICS – they can pay for those courses accordingly. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Questions?",
