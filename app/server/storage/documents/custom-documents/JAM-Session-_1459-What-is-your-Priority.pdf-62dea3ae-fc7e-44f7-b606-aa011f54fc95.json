Presented by: Jasmin Brown, University Registrar, and  Eugenia Johnson, Director of Academic Advising  Methodist University, Fayetteville, NC  1  Jenzabar Annual Meeting Methodist University  2     Fayetteville, North Carolina     Liberal Arts University     About 2500 undergraduate and graduate students     Over 80 different majors, minors, and concentrations Goals  3     Using course priority and reuse settings without any custom coding     Reducing the number of individual degree or course alterations Getting started  4     Set up institutional requirements trees     Decide which category or degree requirement is most important (e.g. general education #2)     Aims at Methodist University  o   Major = 1  o   General Education Core = 2  o   Minor = 3  o   Concentration = 3 5     Prioritize subgroups  o   Categories  o   Groups  o   Electives  o   Courses     Identify any courses or requirements that can only be used to satisfy a single requirement.  o   Global Perspective Elective  o   Liberal Arts Elective Words of Advice  6     Most programs and majors are unique, work on one at a time     Keep in mind that some courses may fulfill more than one requirement     Be consistent in setting the priorities  Planning is key! Function and Purpose of  Priority   and  Reuse   in Jenzabar  7  A numeric   priority   code is used to evaluate requirements that appear more than once at the same level in the institutional requirements. This code determines which occurrence of the requirement receives the highest priority. The lower the number, the higher priority (e.g., the lowest number receives the highest priority). 8  Reuse:   A requirement that appears multiple times in an Institutional Requirement Tree may be satisfied at each point that it appears by setting this value to   Y   (this is also the default).  If this value is set to   N   (uncheck box), only one particular instance of the requirement may be satisfied and all other occurrences will not be used. Degree Components  9     When setting up the different degree components which are the aims (e.g. general education core),groups/categories, and courses start setting up the priorities in that order.     Evaluate each category/course not just in regards to priority but also if the course can be reused.     Methodist University has a common core/general education requirement that students need to complete regardless of the degree. General Education  10  Steps 1: set priority for aim  Step 2: set priority for group  Step 3 : set priority for course Majors  11     When setting up majors the approach is the same as setting up the General Education core: major aim, group, and then course.     Some majors are more complex than others especially, if students can select from different groups or courses to fulfill a single requirement.  Each group and course can be set up differently! Sample Major  12  Step 1: set priority for major  Step 2 : set priority for group  Step 3 : set priority for course Groups and Courses  13     Different majors or aims can have a common group of courses for example “Business Administration” and “Accounting” or “General Education and Major”.     Check “ allow reuse ” because same group and courses required for multiple majors and same priority.     The same course may be an option in several groups within the major.     Uncheck “ allow reuse ” because the course can only be counted once and set different priorities. Common group, different major  14 Multiple Groups, Same Course  15  Priority is the same BUT reuse is only checked on the Elective course group Continued  16 Same course, different aim  17  PSY 1010 General Psychology can be used in the General Education Aim and Psychology Major Aim. Double major, double trouble!  18  Student who chooses to double-major may have some restrictions in regards to counting the same course for more than one requirement. And while a course can fulfill electives for both majors, one major has a higher priority. Example: Marketing and Business Administration  19  Set   Priority 1   for the Elective Courses Group the same following your numbering convention. 20  Set the   Priority 1   for the specific course the same “ # 5” but for  Priority 2   set the number higher for the one with the lower priority Questions or Comments??  21  Jasmin Brown  University Registrar  jabrown@methodist.edu  (910) 630-7035  Eugenia Johnson  Director of Academic Advising  ejohnson@methodist.edu  (910) 630-7588",
