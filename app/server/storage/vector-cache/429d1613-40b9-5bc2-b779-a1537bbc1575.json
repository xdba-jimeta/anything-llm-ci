A   CTIVATING   A   CADEMIC   P   LANNING In order for J1 Web academic planning to be implemented, the Advising Module Manager must activate it from the Advising Settings. Academic planning can be activated in two modes:  •   Setup   allows Advising Administrators to build plans without making them available to advisors and students. Advising Administrators can build plans, share them with others, update them appropriately based on feedback, and designate them as ready to be published, but they cannot publish them. This ensures plans are not associated with students and advisors cannot access them until they are ready. Once your school is confident the plans are ready, you can switch Academic Planning to   On .  •   On   allows Advising Administrators to build plans and proceed with publishing them to make them available to advisors and students.

This page lists all the academic programs for a selected catalog year. They can be filtered by status and sorted by name, status, degree, and requirements. You can search for a specific plan and link to additional information about the program or the plan (if the program has been published). Actions currently provide two options:  •   For programs that are ready to be used to create a draft plan, the   Create academic plan draft  option is available allowing you to create the draft plan based on the program  •   For programs that have been used to create draft plans, the   Review plan   option is available allowing you to access detailed draft plan information  When reviewing programs that are not ready for a plan, you can look at the   Program  Requirements   column to identify which institutional requirement trees in J1 Desktop need completing or review.

The Plan Layout Details page appears where you can review which courses have been assigned to which years. You can also export the layout to a PDF file. FAQ  What do the hours in a year/term mean?  The number of hours shown for a particular year/term are the total the number of requirement hours that have already been planned.  How are the years/terms determined?  The system looks at your school's IPEDS configuration, which determines if your school is a 4-year or 2- year school, and your NSC term configuration, which determines if you are using standard/non-standard terms in J1 Desktop. When you edit the plan layout, you can select other time frames.  Why can't I edit the plan layout information?  If the academic plan has been published, the plan layout information cannot be updated as it may be in use by students.

FAQ  Where do program requirements and hours come from?  Program requirements including required number of hours, requirements groupings, AND/OR relationships and plan details are all defined on the J1 Desktop   Institutional Requirements Tree .  Why can't I update the academic plan?  There could be several reasons you cannot update the academic plan:  •   You don't have the appropriate permissions.  •   The plan has already been published.

The plan has already been published. Once a plan is published, it can no longer be shared with colleagues for collaboration.  How are the published plans assigned to students?  •   If a student has already selected this program, the plan will be automatically associated to them during the create AV process or the Advising to Registration transfer process or the synch advisee information process in J1 Desktop.  •   If the program is selected for a student on the J1 Desktop   Student Information   window,   Degree  tab for the first time or if they are changing their program, the published plan is associated to them.  What about students who have programs with OR relationship groups?  Programs where a student can chose from different courses to satisfy the requirement are handled once the student is assigned to the plan. For more information, see Student's Academic Plan page.

If a student has a foreign language or free elective requirement, you can select a specific course to meet the requirement.  •   Monitor a student's progress in meeting their requirements. The progress bar at the top of the page shows you how many requirements the student has successfully met.  •   Add and remove time periods. If a student adds a double-major, they may need to add a year/term to their plan in order to meet the requirements without exceeding workload limits.  •   Export the academic plan to PDF, which can be saved and emailed to the student.  •   View copies of the student's unofficial transcript and advising worksheet.
