Presented by Rebecca McCollum Union Institute & University  6/2/2016 – Dallas, TX © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  What do Admissions Administrators have in common with Marty McFly?  On occasion, both need to go back in time...  Identifying the Problem  Haha! Looks like TE! Anyone remember that?? © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Data entry mistakes     Recreation of a record when merging duplicates     Multiple application/inquiry form submissions     Being chased by angry guys with bazooka  Why do we need to travel into history? © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Our IT department created an application that enables us to make changes directly to the stage history table (no plutonium required)  The Solution! © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  1) Delete a line from the stage history of the selected candidacy  2) Rollback (removes all lines with a date AFTER the selected line)  Available changes © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  3) Edit/Update in the following ways:     Change stage itself     Move the line to another candidacy row (if available)     Change stage date     Change count (y/n)  Available Changes (cnt) © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Like every good time traveler, we need to ensure we do not interfere with our parents’ first meeting (or cause foreign key violations!)  Caveats! © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Candidacy     Candidate     Requirements     Stage History     Scholarship     Attachments (we don’t currently use, but you might!)  The script also updates all of these as part of its process as they are all linked to stage history and changing one without the other causes foreign key violations  1) Other involved tables © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Time travel in the wrong hands is a dangerous thing!     Limit access to the tool (we have done so via security group) to admission administrators. All others can make like a tree and get outta here.  2) Security © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Quotes from The Developer (For the Nerds)  •   Everything in this process is “kludgy”, there is no way around it – this is Jenzabar’s code, we’re just trying to hack around it. In some cases you are deleting stage history lines and readding them in a different place – you can’t just move them  •   We’ve made a custom Admission website with lots of different functions – but this stage tool would be great for a JICS portlet  •   The new appid fields really make this easier – use it whenever you can!  •   I will be happy to provide our stored procs, and will be happy to offer advice on making a portlet  shawn.mccollum@myunion.edu © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.
