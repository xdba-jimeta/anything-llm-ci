June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Presented by Claire Mand & Hollie McCrea Olson  Edgewood College  June 2, 2016  Activity Tracking: A Start © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Official record of learning     Recognized and valued by employers and other institutions as proof of qualifications     Can provide an at-a-glance preview of who a person is and where their passions and skills lie     But what is missing . . . ?  Transcripts: Why are they valuable? © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Organization and club participation     Global studies experiences     Civic engagement activities     Outside internships and practicums  Co-curricular transcripts   offer institutional recognition and credibility to some of these experiences, but they must be tracked in an organized and reliable way.  Experiences and Learning Outside of the Classroom © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Tracks, quantifies, and validates work students do outside of the classroom     Validates work that Student Affairs professionals do to educate students     Provides quantitative data for grant proposals, defending budgets, Higher Learning Commission audits, etc.  Our Goal  To give you the basics of how to set up & start activity tracking on your campus  Why is Activity Tracking Important? © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Setting the Stage     Edgewood College has begun activity tracking in EX through a pilot program with Dominican Life (College Ministries)     Previously, Dominican Life activities were tracked in an Access database  •   Pulling reports became cumbersome  •   Duplicate data was collected and entered  •   Lots of room for error  •   Limited to the data collected by Dominican Life  •   Staff knew that other data, including biographical data was collected by the college during the admissions process etc. but couldn’t access this data for reporting     Module Manager was contacted to explore possibilities © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Activity Tracking was a clear home for this data     For years, we’ve been wanting to utilize the functionality     Obstacle: Can’t report on data that isn’t entered in to the database!     Solution: People power to enter the data  •   Utilizing student worker resource, IT background     Requested the appropriate level of access to EX so the student worker and administrative assistant could work independently in both EX and Infomaker  Getting Started © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.

June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Student Life module is organized by session (ex. Fall 2016)  •   We chose to enter a small subset of data from the previous semester to track initially     Took data from the existing Access database report and entered attendance from a small number of activities     This allowed further configuration before we relied solely on Jenzabar. Entering the data was assigned to a staff member. From there our student worker majoring in IT worked to create reports that would pull the data out in a way that was useful and reflective of the previous Access reports.  Getting Started © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Functionality exists in the Student Life Module  Home for Activity Tracking in EX © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.
