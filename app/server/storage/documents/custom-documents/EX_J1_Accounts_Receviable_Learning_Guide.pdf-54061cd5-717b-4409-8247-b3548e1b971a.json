You will be able to access account balances quickly and easily so you can build strong constituent relationships by responding promptly to questions and staying in touch. The module is fully integrated with Jenzabar EX Student Registration, Student Housing, Financial Aid, Payroll, and General Ledger modules, helping you create a seamless Accounts Receivable process.  There are two options for completing Student Billing: you can use Year/Term or Billing Periods.  Once you activate Billing Periods, you will not be able to turn them off. You will also not be able to access the Student Billing windows that relate to Year/Term.  You will need to choose one method to generate student billing charges/fees:  Year/Term   Billing Periods     Choose hours/rates for charges     Setup charges and refunds     Map year/term using Term Group Control     Copy charges and refunds     Process exemptions and waivers     Attach lifetime charges/fees     Generate preliminary charges/refunds     Generate actual charges/refunds     Identify and define billing periods     Choose hours/rates for charges     Setup charges and refunds     Assign exemptions and waivers     Map year/term/subterm to appropriate billing periods     Attach lifetime charges/fees     Generate preliminary charges/refunds (date specific)     Generate actual charges/refunds  - or - EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  9  W ORKING WITH   S TUDENT   A C COUNT   I NFORMATION  When setting up student payments, whether online, in person, or by mail, you will need to work with student information in the EX system.  N AME   E NTITY  Coming from an AR standpoint, you should not have to work/change much on the Name Entity. If you are looking up a student and there is no name entity record, contact Registration.  There are two views for the Name Entity window. The first is a Summary view. From this view, you will see a quick overview of the student, including Name, Biograph, and Address information.  In the Detail view you will see the Individual, Addresses, and Biograph tabs that will offer more information than the overview provided on the Summary tab. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   10  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  While the Name Entity table is important for you to in terms of viewing student information, (for most schools) you should not add a student or make changes to an existing student from an Accounts Receivable aspect. If there is an error, contact Registration or Accounts Payable to find a student record or make changes to a record.  There are three icons on the window that you should be aware of:     Holds   (   ) are represented with the triangle icon to let you know if the student has a hold on their account. To view the hold(s), you can click on the icon to open the Student Holds window.     Notepad   (   ) allows you to make notes and confine the information to just Accounts Receivable. To add a note, click the icon to open the Notepad window.     FERPA Permissions   (   ) are represented with the open or closed padlock. A green, open padlock means that the student is allowing access to a specific person, while a red closed padlock means that no permissions have been granted. When you click the padlock icon, the FERPA Permissions window will open.  FERPA information will be entered on the FERPA Permissions window. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  11  S UBSIDIARIES  Each student has information in the   Subsidiaries   window that should already be setup for the student. On this window, you are going to be concerned with the Subsidiary Code and a Subsidiary Type Code. You will need to associate the student with those two codes, and then the system will automatically pull up the AR History Begin Date. If you want, you can also add an Address code; otherwise, the system will use their standard addresses information.  When you go to run charges, if the student does not already have a subsidiary record, the system will automatically create a record for the student. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   12  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  A/R   I NQUIRY  Use this window to determine the Accounts  Receivable transactions in subsidiary accounts for a student that will be displayed or printed on the   A/R Inquiry Detail   window. You can choose to view or print all AR subsidiaries or all transactions for a specific individual or account. The beginning and ending dates can be used to determine the time period.  When an ID Number is entered, an icon appears that indicates whether any notes exist for that individual. You can click on the icon or right-click on the ID Number to access Notepad capabilities if your system administrator has given you the appropriate rights. If no notes exist, the icon is displayed as a red circle with a red line running through it.  When you click   OK , you will see a detailed list of activity for the student:  From the   A/R Inquiry Detail   window, you can review details on the transactions you selected from the AR Inquiry window. The information is pulled based on source code, group number, and transaction. You can sort your information by clicking on a column in the detail section and reorder your details. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  13  In this window you can further define your information by selecting a Subsidiary Group Code, or Year, or Term. This is a good way to filter your information.  Be aware that your three Total Amounts at the bottom of the window will change based on your filters.  As you are looking at this window, it is important to remember that your balances can have different amounts:     Posted Balance   is only going to include transactions that have a C, Y, or H status.     Balance to Date , will include transactions with a status of U, C, Y, or H.     Balance   (at the bottom of the window) is going to total all transactions.  While on the A/R Inquiry Detail window, you can right-click a transaction to view the   Transaction Detail . This option will pull the transaction information from the TRANS_HIST table.  If you select the   Print Report   checkbox on the   A/R Inquiry   window, you will be presented with a Student Account Printout that will show all of the account history for the dates you selected. By default, this report will bring in all the student balances and activities and then the report will organize the information by month and year. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   14  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  S TUDENT   I NFORMATION   I MPACTING   C HARGES  This window will display any information for a student that will affect the charges and be used to calculate charges. All the information for room and board, tuition and fees, and discounts and third parties will be shown on this window. You can edit some of the fields on this window, but information about registration and student information will be frozen.  Like the Student Information tab, the   Student Term Information   tab will contain student billing information for a specific term. At the bottom of the window is the   Maintain Student Billing Exemptions  button you can click to add, edit, track, and maintain both preliminary and actual exemptions by year/term, billing period, or priority. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  15  S ETTING   U P   A CCOUNTS   R ECEIVABLE  This chapter will review the Accounts Receivable and Student Billing key tables and walk you through some of the configurations you will need to determine before using the module.  O BJECTIVES     Configure Accounts Receivable     Setup Subsidiary tables     Recalculate financial information     Review charges  A/R   C ONFIGURATION  Using this window, you will be able to configure the Accounts Receivable module. It is important that this window is setup before starting any Accounts Receivable activity in Jenzabar EX. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   16  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Balance Forward or  Open Items  You must choose either Balance Forward or Option Items.     Balance Forward   is used if your organization creates charges and makes payments to general subsidiary balances carried over from term to term.     Open Items   is used if your organization creates charges and applies payments to individual charges rather than the running account balance. This may or may not appear on your window depending on what licenses you have.  This setting will affect all users.  Accounting Method   This may or may not appear on your window depending on what  licenses you have. In this section, you have two options: Accrual or Cash Based.     Select the   Accrual method   if your organization recognizes business transactions as they occur.     Select the   Cash Based method   if your organization does not recognize a transaction until cash is received or paid.  If you are using the Cash Based method, you must also use the Open Items option.  Thi rd Party Options   Do the students have the ultimate responsibility for the debt? If No,  you can select the   Process Third Party as Subsidiary   checkbox and setup the charges so they bypass the student and go directly to the third party.  You may use this option for Veterans or teachers taking courses.  Receipt options   This will be your default setting for the   Receipt Entry Detail   window.  You will still have the option to print the receipt from the Receipt Entry Detail window. When you go to print receipts through the module, there is a window where you can determine if receipts are printed. Many schools do not print receipts because of electronic methods; however, sometimes they may need to print for a student or transaction.  Another important element to this section is the   Select Printer?  option. By default, an unchecked box will automatically send the receipt to your default printer. If you want to select the printer, be sure to check this checkbox.  Online  Configuration Items  This secti on will allow you to setup the online configuration:  Online/Offline   Do you want payments to be processed  online? If yes, select from the options below. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  17  Processor   What third party processor will process your  online payments? Usually, you will choose between the two main processors Authorize.net or CashNet.  Online Payment  Receipt Group  Select from the list of all printers available.   The  printer selected will determine the receipt group in which the online payment(s) will be included.  Display  Preliminary Financial Aid Online?  This option will determine if students will be  able to see any initial financial aid.  Display  Unposted Items Online?  Select this check box to allow unposted items to  be displayed.  Display  Preliminary Charges Online?  Select this check box to allow preliminary  charges to be displayed.  Course and Fee  Statement  You have two options for the Course and Fee Statement. When  checked, the   Bill Remaining   checkbox will allow you to indicate that the student’s entire bill is due for the statement. Unchecked, the next amount due will be indicated on the statement. When checked, the   Use Period End Month for Payment Plan Month   checkbox will use the month from the period end date on the Subsidiary Control to determine what transactions and balances are displayed on the statement. When unchecked, you must manually enter a month in the Payment Plan Month column.  Course Registration  Refunds Based On  You have two status options: Transaction or Billing.     With   Transaction Status , refunds are based on the transaction. Any student who drops a course after the census date will not receive a refund.     With   Billing Status , refunds are based on the billing. Students who drop a course after the census date will still receive the refund.  Open Items Options   Use the checkboxes to select the following features:  Reallocate  Credits  This option will automatically retrieve and apply  credits to any Open Items created in the batch that is being processed.  Allocate  Financial Aid  This option will allow the Financial Aid  Disbursements and Adjustments process to apply financial aid to existing charges automatically.  Allow A/R Credit  Invoices to be created on Debit Balances  Accounts Receivable requires a credit balance  to create invoices in Accounts Payable. This option allows you to generate invoices in AP for students that have a debit balance. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   18  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Enhanced Student  Billing Option  This checkbox will determine how multiple billing periods are handled during the enhanced student billing process. If you select this checkbox, a separate batch will be generated for each billing period. If you do not select this box, all batches will be combined into a single batch.  This option will only appear if you are using billing periods to generate student charges, and you have an active billing period.  S UBSIDIARY   D EFINITION FOR   A/R  Subsidiaries make up the core of the Accounts Receivable module. Every task in Accounts Receivable centers on the need to create charges and credits for subsidiary accounts. A subsidiary is a group of individual balances, such as Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable that are linked to one General Ledger account. The General Ledger account serves as the control account, and the subsidiary accounts track the details. The sum of the subsidiary balances should always equal the balance in the control General Ledger account.  The   Subsidiary Definition For A/R   window lists all subsidiary accounts used in Accounts Receivable. From this window, you can define the account numbers and edit the parameters of the subsidiaries.  Be aware that the subsidiary codes and descriptions are being pulled form General Ledger. You cannot add a row from this screen. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  19  Subsidiary Code   The two character subsidiary code identifies each subsidiary control account. This field cannot be updated.  This window is tied to the   Subsidiary Group Control  window. Make sure that if you create a new Subsidiary Group, there should be a corresponding Subsidiary code.  Descriptions   This brief explanation of the subsidiary code is used as a header for subsidiary accounts on statements. This field cannot be updated.  Finance Charge  Account #  If your school applies finance charges, you can setup the receiving account from this window. By right-clicking in this field, you can access the   G/L Master Account Codes   window and select a G/L account.  Receipting  Priority  This field determines the code’s priority when applying payments to charges. The lowest number is processed first.  This field is required if the subsidiary account code or subsidiary is designated as an open item.  Financial Aid  Priority  This field is used by the Agency Billing feature in the Financial Aid Manager.  Default Receipt  Co de  Each subsidiary account will have a unique receipt code. The system uses this code to retrieve important transaction information such as description, offset account, and target account.  Default A/R SBS  Type  This code is a unique two-character identifier that categorizes the subsidiary type.  Web Payment  Receipt Code  Select from the available codes that will identify the receipt transaction that originated from the Web for your organization.  Open Items or  Balance Forward  For each subsidiary code, you must select the Open Items or the Balance Forward option. Choose   Balance Forward   if your organization creates charges and makes payments to general subsidiary balances carried over from term to term. Choose   Open Items   if your organization creates charges and applies payments to individual charges rather than the running account balance.  Default Payment  Plan Code  If the subsidiary code is associated with a payment plan, you can select the plan from the drop-down options.  Include in  Receip t Entry  Balance?  This feature allows you to select the items you want to show on the receipts. For example, if you have multiple subsidiaries and want only one of them to appear on the receipt you can select the checkbox on the subsidiary account you want to see.  If you do not select a checkbox for at least one subsidiary, you will not see a balance listed on the receipt. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   20  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  S UBSIDIARY   G ROUP   C ONTROL  If you have a subsidiary account listed in General  Ledger, you will also need to have a corresponding code listed in the   Subsidiary Group Control   window. Use this window you to define the name and description of the subsidiary groups you will create for your organization.  This window goes hand-in-hand with the Subsidiary Definition for A/R window.  From the right-click options, you can open the  Subsidiary Group Control Relationship   window where you define the subsidiaries that are included in the group.  Use the Subsidiary Group Control window to define A/R subsidiaries included in subsidiary groups and determine which are used for reporting and statements.  A subsidiary group may consist of as few as one subsidiary account and as many as all of your subsidiary accounts.  The Subsidiary Group Code and Subsidiary Group Description are displayed so that you know the group you are defining, but you cannot change the values of these fields from this window. The A/R subsidiaries in the left panel are not included in the group. The subsidiaries in the right pane are included in the group. To change what subsidiaries are included in the group you can use the Add and Remove buttons between the columns, or you can drag and drop the subsidiaries. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  21  S UBSIDIARY   T YPE   C ONTROL  This is where you can define your groups. For example, you may have subsidiaries for student collections, current students, employees, day care, etc. The   Subsidiary Type Control   window is where you can determine the Subsidiary Type code on the Subsidiaries window for students. These codes are tied to student accounts, and used to group your students. For example, you may want to have a group for students and a group for employees. You may also want to have a group for former students or exchange students.  The Subsidiary Type code on the student’s Subsidiary window must be manually updated.  There is a system default for All Types that comes pre-installed with the software (Do not delete). EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   22  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Code   Displays the subsidiary group control code.  Description   This field shows a brief explanation of the subsidiary group control code.  Statement  Address  The statement address allows you to enter your school’s name and mailing address that will appear on your statements.  The statement address is there, however most schools choose to write their statements to be customized so that it will not look directly at the statement address. If you see an address on your statement, just be aware that it may be pulling from this window.  Default  Statement  Messages  This option is where you can make quick notes or comments that will appear on your statements for that specific subsidiary type code. For example, you may want to write a message to students letting them know when classes start or campus hours. You can also write a comment thanking a student for paying their bill or letting the student know a bill is past due.  If you are not using multiple subsidiary types, but instead are only using the   All Statements   option, you will be able to use the balance messages. In addition to the default messages, you can also create custom balance messages that will be conditional to the student’s statement balance.  You can right-click and go to   Subsidiary Type Statement Balance Messages  and determine what message students get on the student’s billing status (credit, debit, or zero balance).

You can define an unlimited number of subsidiary control accounts. However, you should be aware of the possible complexities as you choose your subsidiary structure because the following functions may become more complex as the number of subsidiaries increases:     Creating Charges:   When the system creates charges (such as tuition), is it easy to identify which subsidiary account will receive the charge? Are there some charges that might be split between two subsidiary accounts?     Applying Payments:   If a payment or a financial aid award comes in, how do you apply it to a list of balances? Is there a \"pecking\" order as to which subsidiary account is paid off first?     Creating Subsidiary Master Rows:   Although Subsidiary Master rows are usually created automatically, adding subsidiary control accounts means you have more subsidiary accounts to track.     Statements:   These are often longer and more complex due to more subtotals and totals.

There are many tables you will need to configure before charges can be generated and the statements sent to students.  Charges  Use this window to establish charges and determine the tables and columns used for the fees. This window is also used to add, edit, and delete charge codes. You can define the description of the charge, which variable information is used in the database, and the charge type. If it is a course charge, you can also determine whether the course number should appear in the course description.  There are six types of charges:  1   Term Charges for Students (S)   – These charges are made on a term-by-term basis (ex. tuition, meals, or registration fees)  2   Term Charges for Courses (C)   – These charges are course specific (ex. lab or organization fees)  3   Annual Charges for Students (A)   – These charges are made and applied only once each year (ex. parking, activity, or insurance fees)  4   Lifetime Charges for Students (L)   – These charges are made and applied only once to each student (ex. graduation fees)  5   Discounts (D)   – These amounts are credits that reflect discounts for other fee codes (ex. faculty tuition discount)  6   Everytime Charges (E)   – These charges are made and applied every time the charge process is run (ex. drop- add fee) EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   36  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You can delete charges, but make sure those charges are no longer being used. You may want to keep a record or screenshot of charges you delete.  The description is only for your benefit only. The students will not be able to see your charge code description.  This Master tab on the   Charge Definition/Detail Entry window   is used to define charge codes. For every charge code you enter on the Master tab, you should have one or more entries on the Detail tab. When you save a new charge definition from this tab, a row will be inserted into the Charge Fee Definition table since it is related to the Charge Definition table.  Fee Code   This two-character code identifies the type of charge that can be automatically generated on the basis of registration data.  Charge Desc   This field can be used to briefly describe the fee code.  1098 - T Eligibility   This option allows you to assign the 1098-T related value to a transaction. Select the type of eligibility form the drop-down list:   Eligible Charge (C)   or   Eligible Grant/Scholarship   (G) . By choosing 1098-T eligibility on this window, the system will automatically flag the eligible charges calculating them and placing them in the 1098-T reports.

Apply to Th ird  Party  This checkbox will indicate that you want the liability of paying for this charge to be applied to a third party.  Receipt Pty   This number identifies the fee code’s priority when applying to charges on the   Receipt Entry Detail   window. Fee codes with the lowest numbered priority codes will be processed first.  Constants   The Constants 1 to 10 can be used to designate a value, instead of a variable, that will be compared to the Charge Elements on the Charge Details table.  Element Usage   This option determines the computation amounts. For example, how much of the fee will applied per credit. This must be use only once and listed on the last row of the criteria.  Table Codes   These ten options allow you to setup criteria for your charges.  Column Codes   There ten options are the items the criteria is searching for within the tables selected.  On the Detail tab, you will determine what the fees will be and when to apply the fee. You will need to make sure that you go out and make a charge for each year and term. You can sort your columns by selecting the   Sort icon and using the click-drag feature to determine the order of your columns. This is an especially nice feature to help organize your charges when you have multiple terms/years. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   38  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  In order for the fees to be applied, the charges will look for the table and columns identified on the Master tab. Then on the Detail tab, the system will look at the charge element criteria. If all criteria is met, the system will then look at the information in the Detail tab to determine how much to charge the student.  For every charge code you enter on the Master tab, you should have one or more entries on the Detail tab.  Variable Files for Charges  This window will identify which tables can be used in your Automatic Charge Generation. Normally, this table is setup by your school’s IT department and you will not have to make changes to this window; however, if your organization adds a table that you will need in to use with your charges this is the window you would use to add the table to your available options.

Use this window to enter your organization's hours codes and to determine the variables that will be used to total student credit hours, tuition hours, or course counts. Each hours code entered on this window should have one or more corresponding entries on the Detail tab.  Depending on your terminology, you may use the term hours or buckets. In this document, both terms are used with the same meaning.  Buckets work on the same principle as charges but they are based on hours.

EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  41  Refunds  Use this window to enter the tables and columns that will  be used to define refunds. Many organizations use the Student Master and the Student Course History tables (the same tables used for generating charges) for this purpose. When you create your refund table, the refund codes  must match   the charge codes. They must link. While refunds must match charges, there may be charges you do not want to refund, so there may be more charge codes than there are refund codes.  All refund charges must be setup before you issue any charges; otherwise, your refunds may not work properly.  There are four types of refunds that you can work with:  1   *ALL : With this code, you will have one column for each year/term and determine the amount of refund to be given.  If you use multiple GL account numbers with a particular charge, you cannot use this option.  2   *DAYS:   This code will allow you to set refund amounts based on the number of days the individual attended the class.   You can only use this charge code on course type charges.  You must consider the weekends when counting the days for the *DAYS code.  3   %DAYS:   This code will take the percentage of time spent in the class instead of a specific number of days.   This is different from *DAYS because *DAYS will count weekends while %DAYS will only count time in class.   This code is used by most clients.  4   Copy Charges:   This code will allow you to copy your charges to refunds, and however your master and detail charges were setup they will appear the same in refunds.   Then you will need to go into your detail tab and choose your refund percentage. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   42  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Refund Fee  Code  This code is used to identify the refund definition and associates it with a fee code on the Charge Definition table.  Hours  Description  This field allows you to enter text that will help identify the refund definition.  Constants   These values will be used when totaling student hours. The Constants 1 to 10 can be used to designate a value, instead of a variable, that will be used when generating student refunds.  Element Usage   Usage determines how variables can be used when determining refunds. Usage codes: *ALL, *DAYS, %DAYS, Copy Charges.  No usage code is used in the Refund Definition when using the   *ALL   method.  Table/Column  Codes  These fields, in combination with the variable tables, will identify each database element (table/column combination) that will be used to determine the criteria for refunds. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  43  Refund Element   The combination of values in these columns identifies certain types of refunds that should be given.  Year/Term   Reports, transcripts, statements, etc. use the academic year and term to select, sort, and print.  Be sure to pay attention to the year/term on this window. You can delete previous years/terms.  Refund Desc.   This description will appear on the student’s transaction and statement for this refund.  Subsidiary Acc #   This is the G/L subsidiary control account to which charges/refunds will be applied.  Income/Expense  Acct  This is the offsetting account number from the G/L to which the charge will be applied.  Refund  Percentage  This is the percent of the original charge that will be refunded to the person if the criteria for the Refund Detail row are met.  Do not enter 100%. Enter 1.0000. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   44  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You must setup the Refund Table prior to running actual charges. The reason for that is because when a student registers for a class, the system is going to look at the transaction and billing status and it will look at the Process AR Refunds Flag. It will be blank until the student is actually   charged (C)   the fee. When the charges have been refunded it will show as   processed (P) .  Refunds here are registration refunds not an Accounts Payable check you will cut for the student.  The refund codes must be the same as the charges codes.  Copying Charges and Refunds  Use this window to copy charge information from one year and term to another term or to copy charge information to refund information. Building new year/term detail data from existing data or building refund data from charge data saves time when setting up charges and refunds for a new term.  The right pane contains information currently in the destination Charge or Refund Definitions. The left pane contains information that can be copied to the right pane. To remove specific fee codes from the list of codes to be copied, select the fee code to be removed, and click the Remove button. When prompted for a year and term code, enter the destination year and term.  Refund Codes   must match to current Charge Codes EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  45  You will want to keep your charge tables clean by deleting/updating the charge codes each year. You will not want to charge a student for a previous year, so you will need a new or updated code. If you do not delete the old codes, you can end up with too many unusable codes that can make it more difficult to find the correct codes. The Copy Criteria options (two categories with three choices each) are as follows:  Criteria One   This criteria determines the information that is copied.  Definitions   Only the definition rows will be copied according to your  specifications from Charges to Refunds.  You cannot copy definitions for Charges to Charges nor Refunds to Refunds.  Definitions and Details   Both definition and detail information is copied for  Charges to Refunds.  You cannot copy definitions for Charges to Charges nor Refunds to Refunds.  Details   Only detail information is copied for either Charges to  Refunds, Charges to Charges, or Refunds to Refunds. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   46  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Criteria Two   This criteria   determines the source of the information to be copied and the  destination to which it will be copied.  After copying this information, you may need to view the new rows that were created to ensure they are correct.  Charges to Refunds   This will copy the information designated in the first set of  choices from Charges to Refunds.  Charges to Charges   This option indicates that only Details will be copied from Charges to Charges.  Refunds to R efunds   This option copies Details form Refunds to Refunds.  If you select the following criteria sets, the   Year Term Popup   window appears:     Definitions and Details and Charges to Refunds     Details and Charges to Refunds     Details and Charges to Charges     Details and Refunds to Refunds  Note that the radio button does not move, and will not move until you complete the popup window items and click   OK . Now on the left hand side, you will see all the charges in your current table. Depending on how many years you have in your database you may have a long list, so you will want to do some filtering to make sure you copy the correct files in the new term.  Term Group Control  When you are going to setup charges, the first step you want to take is to setup your Term Group Control window.  These codes must be created before generating automatic charges for a new year and term.  There are a few important sections to this window:  Allow to  Generate  Charges  This section allows the administrator to select when and where charges can be generated.     You will always want to select the Business office.     Some schools will also allow the registration office to generate charges when students register for a class or drop a class.     If you allow students to register for classes online, you can allow the charges to generate when the student registers online.

Before you can generate your charges, you will need to make sure you remove the old year and term from the right column, and add the new year and term.  If you forget to update the year and term, you will not get the correct results when running your charges.  You can have multiple terms opened for registration, but you must have your charge tables setup properly before you can run any charges. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   48  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  C HARGING   S TUDENTS  Once you have setup student billing, you can start  to place charges on a student’s account.  When using the year/term method for student billing, you will want to go to the   Student Charges  window to generate charges to your students.  Even though the charges are automated, they are not automatic. There is still a button you need to push to issue charges and make the charge/refund table work. This is the window that will make the charges and refunds work.  One way to run charges is to run a batch. To run a batch you will want to select a query. There are three queries that come with the software (you can identify them by the word Original that will be at the end of the query). There should also be a few custom queries that your school has created, which will run much faster and help you specify your results. You can also run charges for one individual by selecting the  Individual   checkbox and entering a student’s ID number.  You will want to select the date, year/term, actual/preliminary, and any override information. When you click   OK , the system will go out (pulling information based on your charge, refund, and term group control tables) and grab all of the students matching information, generating charges for each student. The report will show charges, accounts, and amounts all activity.

This chapter only applies if you are using Billing Periods to run Student Billing.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Setup student billing with billing periods     Create new billing periods     Copy charges and refunds     Generate student billing  W ORKING WITH   B ILLING   P ERIODS  Billing periods allow you to associate charges to a specific period of time, rather than a year and term. Using start and end dates, you are able to determine which charges need to be included in the billing process.  If you are switching to billing periods, from the year/term method, you will want to first run a batch of charges with the existing setup. Keep the report from that process for comparison. Activate billing periods, and run preliminary charges in a test environment to crosscheck the results from your previous report. If the charges match up, you are ready to run charges. If charges do not match, you need to double check your billing periods to ensure they are properly mapped to your existing academic and financial records.  Billing Period s Window  Billing periods are crucial to the billing process. You will need to define your school’s billing periods to coincide with the years, terms, and subterms for both course and non-course billing. Below, you will see some of the important elements to consider when setting up a billing period.  Active Billing  Periods  Any billing periods you create that are marked as active, will appear on the top section of the window. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   50  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Inactive Billing  Periods  Any billing periods that are not marked as active will appear in the inactive section of the window.  Type   There are three categories for billing periods. You will need to select one for the billing period type:     Standard – these are the traditional billing periods where charges are associated with courses.     Annual – these billing periods create allow you to create separate charges for once a year type fees, usually linked to a student     Lifetime – these billing periods are for one time charges linked directly to a student  Start/End Dates   The start and end dates for a billing period will determine if a billing period will be processed for a given fee calculation run.  The Actual Start/Preliminary End Date will determine when the preliminary billing will no longer occur and the actual charges will begin. If you want to automatically generate actual charges (CG) and stop preliminary charges (@C) this date must be defined.  1098 - T  Academic  Year/Term  The 1098-T Academic Year and Term selected is stamped on transactions created for the billing period when student charges are generated.  Active?   This checkbox will determine if your billing period is active or inactive.  Base Billing  Dates  These dates will be used to determine the preliminary and actual dates for the billing period. Use the drop-down to select if you want to use the billing period, class, section, or term start date.  Checkbox  Options  On the Billing Periods window, there are five checkbox options available at the bottom of each billing period.  Allow JICS Bill ing?   Allows student charges to be generated in CRM Student  Allow RE Billing?   Allows student charges to be generated from EX Registration  Allow AR Billing?

If you are implementing billing periods at the start of a new year/term you will only need to map the Annual and Lifetime charges.  When you click the   Map to academic records   link, the   Map Billing Periods   window will open and you can select the records to be mapped for the billing period you selected.  1   Choose the appropriate checkboxes  2   Select the records that will be identified with the billing period  3   Decide between updating only unmapped records or all records  4   View the number of records that will be updated based on your selections  5   Click   Map .  You will only have to map records when you transition from the Year/Term to the Billing Periods student billing process. Once you start using billing periods, they will automatically be mapped according to the dates you put in the billing period columns. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   52  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  D EFINING   H OURS  When generating student charges, the hours codes will help determine how much should be charged to a student account. Depending on your terminology, you may use the term hours or buckets. In this document, both terms are used with the same meaning.  From the Hours Definitions window, you can add, edit, or review the bucket details, including the criteria for how different types of hours will accumulate.  On the top half of the window, you will setup the code and description then define which tables and columns should be checked to determine the hours. On the bottom half of the window, you will determine the criteria for valid values in the tables and columns defined. You will also select an option for how hours are calculated, based on your organization’s billing process:     Course Hours:   total number of course credit hours a student is taking     Tuition Hours:   total number of tuition hours a student is taking (which may be different than the course credit hours)     Course Count:   total number of courses a student is taking     Course Clock Hours:   total number of hours a student spends in courses they are taking  Any active hour codes will be calculated when running student charges, and will be defined by any active Hours Criteria within the hour code.  Hours should be setup during the initial setup of Accounts Receivable, and will only need to be defined if a new charge setup is needed.  Once you have setup your buckets, you can use them to define charges and refunds.  = HOURS   BUCKETS EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  53  W ORKING WITH   C HARGES AND   R EFUNDS  You will need to setup and maintain the fee codes you want to associate with any charges or refunds.  Defining Char ges and Refunds  To create, edit, or view a fee code, you will use the   Charges/Refunds Definition   window. You can also add or modify details and criteria.  Fee Code   This should be a unique fee code and description. You can check the existing fee codes by clicking the Select Charge/Refund Fee Code icon.  Charges/Refund   These tabs will allow you to switch between charges and refunds to maintain or create new fee codes.  Checkbox  Options  There are three checkboxes available that will determine how charges will be handled. The first two will make the course number and/or billing period appear in the transaction description for course charges generated with the fee code.  The third checkbox will indicate that a third party will be responsible for the charge if you have selected the Auto Generate Third Party Charges option selected on the A/R Configuration window. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   54  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Active?   The Active checkbox will activate the fee code. Only active charges and refunds are processed during student billing.  Definition  Elements  Select table/column combinations to define the criteria for hours, charges, and refunds. Choose an Element Usage option from the drop-down to determine how fees will be computed when running charges. Then add or remove elements using the icons until you are satisfied with your criteria.  Show Inactive  Rows  The bottom part of the window shows Charge Details. You can add as many details as you need. You can also add details but not activate them. When you have inactive details, you can choose to hide or show them using the Show Inactive Rows checkbox.  Project   If the charge is associated with a project, select the project from the drop- down list that will show all current projects associated with any EX User Groups where you are a member.  Export to   Excel   The Export to Excel button will open all of your charge or refund details in Microsoft Excel, which will allow you to view and sort information any way you would like.  Copying Charges and Refunds  When moving from one year or billing period to another, it may be easier to copy charges and refunds to the next year rather than re-creating them.  1   Begin by selecting the type of copy you want to make.   For example, Charges to Charges or Refunds to Refunds.

Billing  Period  You can click the Select Billing Periods icon to view or select the billing periods to be included in the run. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   56  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Preliminary  Mode  Preliminary mode allows you to see what charges will be on the run, without actually billing students. This is a good way to make sure all charges are correct before the actual billing takes place. Do not select this checkbox if you want to run actual charges.  Preliminary charges can only be run if the billing period (s)  has a preliminary status. If the billing period falls outside of the preliminary charge period dates, you will only be able to run actual charges (so your report would be blank).  Scheduling   Click the Scheduling button if you would like to automate the student billing process.  The Transaction Date is only used for manual student billing. If you automate the process, the system will automatically use the date the process is run.

When an exemption or waiver is assigned to a charge/fee code, a green checkmark will appear in the row of the exemption code. If you want to assign an exemption code, click on the yellow caution icon to open the Exemption Fee Code Priority window then prioritize the Charge Fee codes.  As charges are generated through student billing, the process will look for any charges or fees that have an exemption code associated. When an exemption code is found, a discount will be applied to the charge amount based on the exemption rate defined.  You can setup exemptions to be processed based on a rate (percentage) or an amount (in dollars).

Use this window to print a list of transactions that are suspended or unposted within the date range you are processing for the statement run and posted transactions outside the date range. You should determine why the suspended and/or unposted groups are not posted, and then post them if appropriate.  Charges produced through preliminary billing or a trial run of charges (source @C) always have a suspended status and cannot be posted. Therefore, you can ignore them for a regular statement print and update process. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  59  T RANSACTION   G ROUPS  Use this window to enter a new or update existing transactions. If this is a new group of transactions, enter the group's Source, Description, and Date.  The Debit column must equal the Credit column (therefore making the Net = 0) in order for the transaction group to be eventually posted.  Each transaction group will have a Source code. Any transaction with an   @C   batch is a preliminary charge created from the Student Charges window when you select the Preliminary. When you rerun the student charges as Actual, the preliminary charges with the @C source code will automatically be deleted. Preliminary charges cannot be posted.  It is important to note the status code when working with Transaction groups.     Suspended (S):   A group of transactions can be suspended if it is incomplete or incorrect, for example, if the group has invalid account numbers, the group is out of balance, or necessary G/L security access is not available. Suspended transactions do not contribute to any of the balances on the Subsidiary Master row, but they do appear on the A/R Inquiry window.     Unposted (U):   Unposted transactions are error-free transactions that have not yet been posted but have been accepted during data entry or created by other processes. Unposted transactions appear on inquiry windows but do not appear on statements.     Current (C):   Current transactions are error-free transactions that have been posted. Transactions with a   C   status will appear on statements.     Year (Y):   The year status is optional and is used in the special situation where an organization wants the statement to show transactions for the entire term. The   Y   status means the transaction has appeared on a previous statement, will appear on the next statement, and will not contribute to the calculation of the finance charge.     History (H):   The history status means that the transaction has already appeared on the statement and will not appear on the statement again. You can see history transactions using the A/R Inquiry window. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   60  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  M ISCELLANEOUS   C HARGES  This window displays unposted and suspended groups of miscellaneous charge transactions.

Before running this process, you must:     Define your finance charge percentages and/or late fee amounts on the Subsidiary Control window.     Define your finance charges as part of a payment plan on the Payment Plan Control window.     Define the account code to which finance charges/late fees are applied on the Subsidiary Definition window.  You cannot generate finance charges if you have never updated statement balances.  If a student is using a payment plan, then the finance charge percentage defined as part of the payment plan (if any) is used. If the payment plan percentage is used, it is multiplied by either the payment plan balance or the statement balance, depending on the definition of the payment plan. The finance charge is assessed for the number of days since the last Statement Date and Period End Date. Unapplied financial aid and third party payments can be subtracted from the student's balance, thereby lessening the finance charges assessed.  Students may be exempted from finance charges/late fees if their Subsidiary Master row indicates Suppress Finance Charge.  When you click   OK , and this information is processed, a transaction group with a source code of   FC   is created.

The Print A/R Statements report pulls select information directly from the subsidiary control window.  If you are going to run this process for all students, you do not need to worry about the bottom portion of the window. However, if you are going to select specific students you will need to enter the student ID numbers and drag the student names to the Selected Students box.  Use this window to print statement forms, change transaction statuses, and update balances. This window also allows you to update the statement and period balances without running a report. Be sure the statement print process completes before changing the control table attributes and beginning a second process. You cannot run two statement print processes concurrently; however, you can print demand statements or statements as a function of individual charges concurrently with the statement print process.  The   Update Only   button allows you to update the statement balances and/or the period balances without requiring you to run the report. This option is only available if either the   Update Statement Balances  and/or   Update Period Balances   checkboxes are selected.  When the Statement Report is generated, a temporary lock is created in the database. When the report is successfully displayed or printed, the lock in the database is released. If the report ends abnormally, you must clear the lock from the   Clear Locked Reports   window in order to run it again.

If you want, you can change the receipt name (ex. if dad buys something for the student) so that the receipt will reflect the buyer. The balance reflects a students posted balance for subsidiaries selected on the Subsidiary Definition window plus any preliminary or unposted transactions (depending upon how you have configured  A/R).  The balance on the Subsidiary and A/R Inquiry window may be different from the Receipt Entry window depending on what balances you choose to include on the receipt. For example, you may choose to add all AR balances to the receipt, but if the student has a Daycare balance the receipt will not include that fee on the receipt, but the fee will show on the AR Inquiry window. It depends on whether or not you chose the checkbox on the Subsidiary definitions window to show on receipt.  If you leave the Check Number blank, the system will assume the customer paid cash. If there is a number, the system will assume it is the actual check number. If you right-click to Maintenance screen you can choose what appears in the drop-down. For example, if your school only accepts one type of Credit Card you can delete the others, or you can add options such as Bank Wire Transfer.  When you save, the system will allow you to choose where you want your receipt to print (if other than the default), and you will see a receipt number.  Jenzabar does not recommend changing the receipt number. This can lead to problems later.  You will then be presented with the following popup window:     Select   No, to close the Receipt Entry Detail window.     If you select   Yes , the Receipt Entry Detail window will clear and you can start on your next receipt.     When you are finished, and the Receipt Entry Detail window closes, you will see your transactions listed on the Receipt Entry window.

EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   70  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  P ROCESSING   S TUDENT   R EFUNDS  This chapter will explain the process for printing refund checks to students and crediting the student’s balance.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Generate invoices automatically     Generate invoices manually  O VERVIEW  The Accounts Payable module allows you to print checks for students and other persons who have a credit balance in their Accounts Receivable account. There are two methods of creating invoices for printing refund checks:     The system can automatically generate invoices for paying the refunds. Using this method, you can determine the selection criteria a student must meet in order to receive a refund. When you print these refund checks, they are separate from regular check invoices.     You can also enter the invoices manually, specifying the A/R account, student ID Number, and other transaction details. With this method, the refund checks are included in the regular checks run (rather than in the A/R refunds checks run).  G ENERATE   A/R   R EFUND   I NVOICES   A UTOMATICALLY  This procedure allows you to determine the criteria a student must meet before receiving an Accounts Receivable refund. Once you enter the selection criteria, the system locates each student eligible for a refund and creates an invoice for them, thus eliminating the need to enter the invoices by hand for each student.  You can also determine whether to use the student’s net balance across all of their A/R subsidiary accounts or on one specific account. You can also decide what percentage of their credit balance to refund.  This procedure also handles refund checks for students for whom you received third party payments and determines whether a refund check is printed for the third party, the student, or both.  Once the refund invoices are created, A/R refund checks can be printed. The checks are written to students using an ID Number of 999999999 (9 nines); however, their name and address still appear on the check.  After the invoices are created, be sure they are correct. When the invoices are correct and have been posted, print the checks. When printing the   Checks to be Issued Report , these A/R Refund invoices will only generate checks if you specify   Accounts Receivable Checks   in the   Checks to be Processed  choice on the prompt window. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  71  Step 1: Create A/R Credit Invoices Window  This window is used to enter information needed to  create batch refund invoices from A/R Credit balances.  You will use this window when students have credit balance on their A/R Subsidiary account and you want to pay some or all of that credit balance to the students in the form of an A/P check. This process only creates invoices; therefore, to print the checks, these invoices must be run through the Checks Run process.  The   Customize   button will allow you to customize an InfoMaker report or query. When this button is pressed, InfoMaker will be launched from your application. Changes can be made to the report or query format to reflect your individual needs.  Step 2: Invoices  The system will assign the Source Code and Group Number for this group. It will also assign the 999999999 vendor ID but notice that the payment name and address will be for each student. The payment group number will have a different number for each student as well. The system creates an invoice number for each student.  You will want to go in and make any changes as needed before you post the group. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   72  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Step 3: Posting  The next step is to post your invoices. This is done in the transactions group window.  Posting Transactions  1   Access the   Transaction Groups   window.   The window displays a list of all transaction groups.  You can only post those groups that have a status of U (Unposted).  2   Highlight the group(s) you want to post.  3   Click   Post .  4   The selected groups are posted and the window is refreshed.   Only those groups still eligible for posting are displayed.  5   The Post Transactions Report is printed for each group that was posted.

This allows you to select the printer to use for the item.  Once the check register and accounts payable checks have finished printing, you may be notified that an Overflow Report will print. This occurs when there are too many items to fit on the check stub.  After the checks print, a prompt screen will appear to ensure the checks have printed correctly.  Checks printed incorrectly can be re-printed by re-printing all the checks starting with the last correctly printed check.

Per IRS regulations, ALL current calendar year transactions marked 1098-T eligible must appear on the 1098-T form for that year. Transaction history data is extracted based on the transaction date and 1098-T eligibility flag. Once the data has been retrieved, the year and term begin and end dates determine the amounts.  1098-Ts are typically generated in January for the previous calendar year; however, they can be created at any time for one or more individuals. Due dates are usually January 31 for the paper report and February 28 for magnetic media output.  1098 - T Year   Select the year you want to run the 1098-T report.

By law you do not have to give your students a copy of their 1098-T if the scholarship/grant is equal to or greater than their tuition; however, some student’s may want the information, or your school may just send out the information to all students.  Re - Extract Data?   This checkbox will re-extract data that is currently in the transaction history table. The re-extracted data replaces existing data in the Student Year Report table for the selected 1098-T year. If you want to use existing data in the Student Year Report table, do not select this option.

Downloading the 1098 - T.pbl  A 1098t.pbl file is available from the   MyJenzabar website   that allows you to easily correct inaccurate data and save your corrections to the transaction history. This pbl file contains important information on the following:     Transactions for Review Report     Charge Edit Form     Finaid Edit Form     Receipt Edit Form     Other Edit Form  Transaction Review Report  The Transactions to Review report lists potentially erroneous information for transactions that may not appear on the   Error Listing   or   Warning Listing   reports. This report can be generated as frequently as necessary. Once you have one or more of these reports, use one of the three forms (Charge Edit, Finaid Edit, or Receipt Edit, depending on the source code associated with the transaction) to modify the transaction history data.  If the 1098-T Error Listing report displays, the process stops and 1098-Ts are not created. The error listing report lists all errors that must be corrected in order to proceed. If you do not have any errors, you will not see an Error Listing report. If the 1098-T Warning Listing Report displays, no corrections are required to continue; however, you should review the warnings list.

Before you can start a payment plan, you must setup the Payment Plan Control window and define your school’s payment plans.  Payment plan code  This is the unique code identifying the payment plan. It is two characters long  and can contain both numbers and letters.  Payment plan description  This field is used to identity your plan. It will be used in a   number of the  Payment plan reports. EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   84  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Finance charge percentage  This contains the annual percentage rate that you charge if a payment is late.  Do not type in the monthly percentage. The system uses the percentage in the Subsidiary Control table if there is no value here.  If your organization has a different finance charge percentage for payment plans than for regular statement balances, you need to specify the percentage on the Payment plan control table. If you wish to assess the finance charge on the Payment plan balance rather than on the Statement balance, you need to set up the Payment plan control table. Finance charges may be assigned different percentage rates per plan. You can have as many plans as you wish.  Number of Months  Allows y ou to define the number of months the payment plan process will use in  its calculation. The ‘number of months’ column is only accessible when the Standard Percentages radio button is selected.  Month Percentage  The percentages in these columns must add   up to 100%. If you want to enter  12% in a month, type 12. To indicate 12 and a half percent, type 12.5.  Plan Type   Use this section to define Standard, Tailored, or Loan payment plans.  Standard  Percentages  Is selected when you want to define a pa yment plan that will be  routinely used in normal or standard cases. If this option is selected on the Payment Plan Control window, the Month Percentage columns will be editable and the total of these columns must equal 100.  Tailored   Is selected when you want to define a payment plan to fit unique circumstances or situations. If this option is selected on the Payment Plan Control window, the Month Percentage columns will appear as display only. You will add the payment amounts on the Subsidiaries window (payment plan tab).

For example, a student missed his last payment. If they owe $1,000.00 total (statement balance) and the last statement billed for $125.00 (payment plan balance). Is the charge assessed on the $1,000 or the $125?  Subsid iary  Balance  Choose this   option to base the charge on the student's  Statement Balance.

To associate a student with a third party processor, use one of the options below.  1   You can attach the third party ID to a student's master record in the Registration module.   This indicates that the third party is going to pay all of the student's charges.   This is done on the Student tab of the   Student Information   window.  You can also attach the 3rd party in the Accounts Receivable module through the   Student Information Impacting Charges   window.  This method will bill the third party for all charges that were automated, which includes not only tuition but also fees, etc.  2   You can also attach the third party ID to a Course Master record in the Registration module, which causes the third party to pay for every person taking the course.  The 3rd party on the course will be honored before the third party on the student master tab. This however only holds true on course type charges and not on student type charges.

The third party will appear on all transactions for the associated student. The user may adjust the amount that the third party owes by manually changing each transaction for the associated student.  Finance Charges and Third Party Payments  When finance charges are generated, you can choose to include or exclude third party payments from the balance on which finance charges will be calculated.  If you include the third party payments, they will decrease the student balance and the finance charges will be less. If you exclude them, you are charging the student for the entire unpaid balance, even if a third party is responsible for some of those charges.

With the enhanced method, you may choose to either automatically transfer student charges to a third party or manually transfer student charges to a third party.  Manual   Automatic  The manual transfer method is more  flexible and gives you greater control over the transfer. It also allows you to track third party payments using an invoicing system.  The third party's charges are in a separate subsidiary account so that the student's subsidiary account is credited and the charges are put on the third party’s subsidiary account, creating an invoice number. You can use the invoice number when tracking the Third Party’s payment(s).  The manual transfer is done on the  Transfer Third Party Subsidiary  window. This window also has the ability to move charges back to a student's subsidiary account from the third party's subsidiary account.  The automatic transfer method is easier to use, but you do not have as much control over the transfer, and it does not allow you to track the transferred charges with an invoice number.  The automatic transfer method allows you to generate the third party charges during the Student Charges process. To define the charges you want to be transferred, select the   Apply To Third Party   checkbox on the   Charges Definition/Charges Detail Entry   window.  If the student being charged has a third party associated with them and the charge is defined to be applied to the third party, the full charge amount will be transferred to the third party.  The third party's charge is in a separate subsidiary account so that the student's subsidiary account is credited and the charges are put on the third party’s subsidiary account. With the automatic transfer method, no invoice number will be generated to track the transferred charges.

Select the   Process Third Party As Subsidiary   checkbox on the A/R Configuration window.   This tells the system that your organization has configured the system to handle third party billing using the Enhanced Method. By selecting the   Process Third Party As Subsidiary   checkbox only, you are configuring Accounts Receivable to use the   manual transfer method . By selecting the   Process Third Party As Subsidiary   checkbox and the   Auto Generate Third Party Charges   checkbox, you are configuring Accounts Receivable to use the automatic transfer method. It is important to remember that this step determines the direction of all following steps, so be sure that you have selected the correct checkbox(es).  Once your School has decided to configure Accounts Receivable to process the third party as a subsidiary account, it should not change the software's configuration back to the previous settings.  2   Configure the subsidiary type code:   You should set up a Subsidiary Type code that will be attached to your Third Party.   This will be used when you run Third Party statements.   Example: Subsidiary Type:   3P or TP   Subsidiary type description:   Third Party Billing EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide   108  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  3   Configure Charge Tables   (Automatic Transfer Method only) .   If you have configured Accounts Receivable to automatically transfer charges to the third party subsidiary account, you need to define which charges will be eligible to be transferred to the third party subsidiary account during the Student Charges process. You can define the charge on the   Charges Definition/Charges Detail Entry   window. Select the   Apply To Third Party   checkbox to make the charge eligible to be transferred to the third party subsidiary account.   The entire amount of the charge will be transferred to the third party during the Student Charges process. If you have configured Accounts Receivable to   manually transfer   charges to the third party subsidiary account, you do not need to define which charges will be eligible to be transferred to the third party subsidiary account.   After the Student Charges process has been run, you may transfer student charges from the student subsidiary account to the third party subsidiary account using the   Transfer Third Party Subsidiary   window.  4   Define the third party.   Set up the third party in the name master with both an ID Number and address.  5   Attach the Third Party to their own subsidiary record in AR.   A third party subsidiary account must be defined in order to transfer the charges.   Using this method means that the third party has its own subsidiary (charges) account; therefore, you no longer need to use the third party statement to bill the third party. Instead, you may use the regular statement for third party billing purposes.  6   Associate the third party with the student.   To use this method, you must attach the ID Number of the third party to the following:  o   A Student Master row in Registration, which indicates that the third party is going to pay all of the student’s charges (this must be done prior to charge generation)  o   A Course Master row in Registration, which causes the third party to pay for every person taking the course (this must be done prior to charge generation)  o   An individual student course in Registration, which indicates that the third party will pay for that course for that person  o   Individual transactions in Accounts Receivable after charges have been generated, which tells the system that the third party will pay for that transaction  7   Generate student charges.   In Accounts Receivable, use the   Student Charges  window to generate student charges.

You may do this by adjusting the transactions that were created when you ran the Student Charges process.  9   Transfer Balances:   you will need to manually transfer balances if using the Manual Transfer Method.  10   Print statements.   When the charges have been transferred, you can run Statements.   The   Print A/R Statements   window allows you to run the Statements process.   You can print both the student statements as well as the third party statements using the   Print A/R Statements   window.  11   Create Receipts.   If the checkbox   Process Third Party as Subsidiary   on the   A/R Configuration   window is selected, then the option   Third Party Payment   on the   Receipt Entry Detail   window is grayed and unavailable.   Create a receipt using the third party ID.   You can have different receipt codes for student’s payments and third party payments.

Before printing the register, you should check the Subsidiary Control table, which allows you to control balances or groups of students that will be printed on the register.  This report is going out and taking all activity from a student all the way back to when the student was entered into the system.  Many times, the Accounts Receivable report is used in place of this report because it offers more flexibility.  When the History Register Report is generated, a temporary lock is created in the database. When the report is successfully displayed or printed, the lock in the database is released. If the report ends abnormally, you must clear the lock from the  Clear Locked Reports   window in order to run it again.

This window will generate the aging report, which prints a list of accounts showing the age of the debit transactions. Using the subtotals on the Aging Report, you can analyze your outstanding balances.  If you are running the report only to see what students owe in the system, you do not want to select the   Include Credit Balances  checkbox.  If you are trying to reconcile your information with General Ledger, you will want to select the   Include Credit Balances   checkbox.  If you are working with Third Party items then the   Reduce Aging by 3rd Party Amounts  checkbox will be available.  This is a report that you can use to track your overall receivables and how the receivables relate to the General Ledger.  With this process, you will get two reports: Aging and Aging Summary Reports.
