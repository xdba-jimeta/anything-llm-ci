Bryan Frazier  Bluefield College  May 27-30, 2015  328 - Making Notepad Work for You  Jenzabar’s Annual Meeting  May 27 - 30, 2015 Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center  Nashville, TN © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Quick Test © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     This session will focus on moving Communication Management from basic letters and emails to a truly effective tool for External and Internal Communication.  Making Notepad Work for You © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Generic letters with a simple merged address block.     Generic Emails with just a name.     Simple unreportable notes.     Non-traceable internal communication.     Single address emails.  What Constitutes “Basic” © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Breaking the rules  Why do we assume it has to be done this way?  •   We’ve been told to do it this way.  •   We’ve always done it that way.  •   We’ve never seen it done another way.  A simple change can make all the difference... © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Note: NOT ALL IDEAS ARE GOOD IDEAS  It may work for other schools but it’s still a bad idea!!! © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     All merge documents must have their own query.     All merge documents must use the same query.     Different actions can’t use the same merge document.     You can only use daily procedure for outgoing / external communication.     Etc.  What are some of the “Rules”?  Example: mapping in form builder © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Problem: Candidates have multiple email addresses but Jenzabar only has one email field.  I want to send one email to multiple addresses © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     There is only one  “Email”   field on Name_Master, but we can add multiple address codes / rows to Address_Master.     It can be mapped from Form Builder.  We can add as many email accounts as you need. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Early attempt....     Ann Hawkins created view tables for each additional email address “code”.     Then the query used this huge compute to generate the “to” block address.  “admissions@bluefield.edu; anybodybutme@bluefield.edu; ..... ”     This worked until Word ‘2010’  How do we send one action to these addresses? © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Why not pull a row in the query for each email address?  How do we send one action to these addresses? © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     We need to hit every “*EML” email address in the address history...  Let’s take it a step farther  ...for a new account or emergency notification . © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Include specific program information     Include counselor information     Vary information by term     Personalize event dates  Make letters and emails more personal © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     We can use rules and merge fields in the actual shell document.     We can use case statements and formatting when the data file is created by the query.  2 ways to vary the merge © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     If you have special licenses or have completed special training courses, be sure to email your counselor, «preferred_name1» «last_name1», at «email_address1» to learn about the documentation needed for the possibility of earning additional credits.     If you have special licenses or have completed special training courses, be sure to email your counselor, Brenda Workman, at Bworkman@bluefield.edu to learn about the documentation needed for the possibility of earning additional credits.  2 examples in the shell document © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.

Take the Merge a step farther © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc. © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  Customizing on the query side © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.
