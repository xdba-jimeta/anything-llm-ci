This will avoid applying duplicate or conflicting rules to the requisition.  You can create disbursement rules by clicking the Create Disbursement Cycle Rules link on the Create Requisitions or Create PO tab from the  Purchasing Module Setup   window as displayed to the left.  As you will see from the screen capture below, you may define your disbursement cycle code by choosing several types of criteria that will be applied towards the requisition.  Choose from the following components when defining a disbursement cycle:     Assign an approval track     Allow changes to be made to the approval track after it has been assigned to a requisition     Prevent, accept, or display a warning when a purchase order exceeds the amount on the requisition     Prevent, accept, or display a warning when an invoice exceeds the amount on the purchase

precedence when creating 1099 forms.  Using the illustration above, assume that the 1099-INT form has been selected as the default for a specific subsidiary on the   Vendors   tab.  This means that if the vendor meets the minimum IRS requirements in transactions for the year, the 1099- INT form will be generated.  If the vendor has NOT met the minimum IRS requirements in transactions for the year, and the vendor still requires this particular form, you must select 1099-INT on the   Required Govt Forms   tab.  Now the 1099-INT form will be generated for the vendor in any case since it has been selected on the  Required Govt Forms   tab.  If for some reason you decide to NOT send the 1099 - INT form to the vendor but it has  already been selected on the   Required Govt Forms   tab, you can remove the   Create Form   checkbox from Step 2 of the Government Forms Filing Wizard and proceed to Step 5 where the vendor will be skipped when the form is printed.

Therefore, if you need to make any changes to the name, type, organization code, address, phone, fax, relationships, or attributes, you will need to access the Name Master.  On the   Vendor s window, right-click in header and select the   Name Entity   option     This will open the   Name Entity   window in Common so you can make the necessary changes.  After you have made changes to the Name Master, the changes will also be reflected in the Vendor Master.

In the example shown below, the Paper Order profile has been chosen and, after the   Assign   button has been clicked, the information that has been identified with the profile will populate the fields for the line item.  REMEMBER: If you have chosen to use vendor specific inventory codes on the Create Requisitions tab of the Purchasing Module Setup window, you must first select the vendor on the Suggest a Vendor tab before assigning a detail line item.

you are ready to begin the process of turning the requisition into an actual purchase order. In preparation for this, you may want to take one last look at the requisitions and make any last minute changes. You may also want to consolidate several requisitions for the same vendor into a single purchase order.  Go to the   Change Requisitions for PO Consolidation   window. From this window, you will be able to quickly view the basic information for a requisition and perform any of the following tasks:     Click on any requisition number to edit the details     Make sure the   OK To Group   checkbox is selected to consolidate several requisitions into one purchase order per vendor  o   You may only consolidate line items that have the same vendor ID number, date to order, ship to code, and disbursement cycle type

discussed earlier in this chapter, whenever a requisition is created, an encumbrance occurs. Therefore, once a requisition has been denied, you can choose one of the options displayed in the screen capture below:  Leave encumbered,  don't delete  The amount of the requisition will be counted against the budget until the  requisition has been deleted. This option will continue to impact the budget.  Unencumber,  delete  Releases any encumbrance that has been created and deletes the requisition  when it has been denied. Any comments or attachments that have been associated with the requisition will also be deleted.  Unencum ber, don't  delete  Releases any encumbrance that has been created but does not delete the  requisition when it has been denied. This option allows you to copy the contents of a denied requisition into a new requisition along with any comments or attachments that may have been associated with the requisition.

An encumbrance is any liability, contract, purchase order, payroll commitment, or tax that has been charged towards a specific account. Once an encumbrance has been identified, this amount is no longer accessible and affects the available balance in the account or budget.  After the encumbrance has been paid, the actual amount becomes an expense.  When you create a requisition or a purchase order, the amount of that requisition or purchase order is an 'encumbrance' – that is, the money has been allocated even though the goods or services may not yet been received and the invoice has not yet been paid.  An unencumbrance is created by either:     Generating an invoice     Creating a manual unencumbrance  To explain the concept of encumbrances, two different case studies are illustrated below.  

accounting structure.  However, when liquidating the encumbrance from a prior fiscal year, you must use a date from the fiscal year in which the purchase order itself was created otherwise the free balance for the current year will be inflated.  For example, if the current fiscal year is July 2009 – June 2010 and you are clearing an encumbrance in August 2010, you should use a June 30, 2010 date so that the unencumbrance credit will not calculate as an increase in the free balance for the 2010/2011 year.

Invoice  $100  Transaction Date 06/30  Prior fiscal year (rather than 07/07 new fiscal year)  Budget UNENCUMBERED  Expense Debited  AP Credited  $100  $100  $100  Pay Invoice  $100  Date on Check 07/12  New fiscal year  AP Debited  Cash Credited  $100  $100  Impact  By backdating the invoice transaction date, budget activity occurs in the same fiscal year and the budget properly reflects the remaining available budget for that year which is $0. Also, the expense is recognized in the prior fiscal year – a true reflection of when the expense was incurred.  By setting the invoice payable date in the new fiscal year, the invoice will be captured and paid in the new fiscal year so cash activity is reflected in the new fiscal year which is when the check was actually issued.  You can backdate the invoice as long as the prior fiscal year remains open – once the year is closed, you cannot use this method.
