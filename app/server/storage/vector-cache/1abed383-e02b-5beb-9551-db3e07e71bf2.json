On this window, you are going to be concerned with the Subsidiary Code and a Subsidiary Type Code. You will need to associate the student with those two codes, and then the system will automatically pull up the AR History Begin Date.

Every task in Accounts Receivable centers on the need to create charges and credits for subsidiary accounts. A subsidiary is a group of individual balances, such as Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable that are linked to one General Ledger account. The General Ledger account serves as the control account, and the subsidiary accounts track the details. The sum of the subsidiary balances should always equal the balance in the control General Ledger account.  The   Subsidiary Definition For A/R   window lists all subsidiary accounts used in Accounts Receivable. From this window, you can define the account numbers and edit the parameters of the subsidiaries.  Be aware that the subsidiary codes and descriptions are being pulled form General Ledger.

This window goes hand-in-hand with the Subsidiary Definition for A/R window.  From the right-click options, you can open the  Subsidiary Group Control Relationship   window where you define the subsidiaries that are included in the group.  Use the Subsidiary Group Control window to define A/R subsidiaries included in subsidiary groups and determine which are used for reporting and statements.  A subsidiary group may consist of as few as one subsidiary account and as many as all of your subsidiary accounts.  The Subsidiary Group Code and Subsidiary Group Description are displayed so that you know the group you are defining, but you cannot change the values of these fields from this window. The A/R subsidiaries in the left panel are not included in the group. The subsidiaries in the right pane are included in the group.

For example, you may have subsidiaries for student collections, current students, employees, day care, etc. The   Subsidiary Type Control   window is where you can determine the Subsidiary Type code on the Subsidiaries window for students. These codes are tied to student accounts, and used to group your students. For example, you may want to have a group for students and a group for employees. You may also want to have a group for former students or exchange students.  The Subsidiary Type code on the student’s Subsidiary window must be manually updated.  There is a system default for All Types that comes pre-installed with the software (Do not delete).

Statement  Address  The statement address allows you to enter your school’s name and mailing address that will appear on your statements.  The statement address is there, however most schools choose to write their statements to be customized so that it will not look directly at the statement address. If you see an address on your statement, just be aware that it may be pulling from this window.  Default  Statement  Messages  This option is where you can make quick notes or comments that will appear on your statements for that specific subsidiary type code. For example, you may want to write a message to students letting them know when classes start or campus hours. You can also write a comment thanking a student for paying their bill or letting the student know a bill is past due.

The process will go back to the previous year balance and then calculate all new balances by locating all transactions in the General Ledger with unposted, current, or year statuses and synchronize them.  Make sure no one is working in your database when you run a recalc.  Once started, the recalc process can only be cancelled before it begins to update the AP Master table.

Use this window to enter your organization's hours codes and to determine the variables that will be used to total student credit hours, tuition hours, or course counts. Each hours code entered on this window should have one or more corresponding entries on the Detail tab.  Depending on your terminology, you may use the term hours or buckets. In this document, both terms are used with the same meaning.  Buckets work on the same principle as charges but they are based on hours. For example, if it meets the Hours Elements, then take the credit hours and put them in a specific bucket that is based on the set criteria.  = HOURS   BUCKETS EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide

This is a good way to make sure all charges are correct before the actual billing takes place. Do not select this checkbox if you want to run actual charges.  Preliminary charges can only be run if the billing period (s)  has a preliminary status. If the billing period falls outside of the preliminary charge period dates, you will only be able to run actual charges (so your report would be blank).  Scheduling   Click the Scheduling button if you would like to automate the student billing process.  The Transaction Date is only used for manual student billing. If you automate the process, the system will automatically use the date the process is run.

If this is a new group of transactions, enter the group's Source, Description, and Date.  The Debit column must equal the Credit column (therefore making the Net = 0) in order for the transaction group to be eventually posted.  Each transaction group will have a Source code. Any transaction with an   @C   batch is a preliminary charge created from the Student Charges window when you select the Preliminary. When you rerun the student charges as Actual, the preliminary charges with the @C source code will automatically be deleted. Preliminary charges cannot be posted.  It is important to note the status code when working with Transaction groups.     Suspended (S):   A group of transactions can be suspended if it is incomplete or incorrect, for example, if the group

Before running this process, you must:     Define your finance charge percentages and/or late fee amounts on the Subsidiary Control window.     Define your finance charges as part of a payment plan on the Payment Plan Control window.     Define the account code to which finance charges/late fees are applied on the Subsidiary Definition window.  You cannot generate finance charges if you have never updated statement balances.  If a student is using a payment plan, then the finance charge percentage defined as part of the payment plan (if any) is used. If the payment plan percentage is used, it is multiplied by either the payment plan balance or the statement balance, depending on the definition of the payment plan. The finance charge is assessed for the number of days since the last Statement Date and Period End Date.

O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Generate invoices automatically     Generate invoices manually  O VERVIEW  The Accounts Payable module allows you to print checks for students and other persons who have a credit balance in their Accounts Receivable account. There are two methods of creating invoices for printing refund checks:     The system can automatically generate invoices for paying the refunds. Using this method, you can determine the selection criteria a student must meet in order to receive a refund. When you print these refund checks, they are separate from regular check invoices.     You can also enter the invoices manually, specifying the A/R account, student ID Number, and other transaction details. With this method, the refund checks are included in the regular checks run (rather than in the A/R refunds checks run).

Once you enter the selection criteria, the system locates each student eligible for a refund and creates an invoice for them, thus eliminating the need to enter the invoices by hand for each student.  You can also determine whether to use the student’s net balance across all of their A/R subsidiary accounts or on one specific account. You can also decide what percentage of their credit balance to refund.  This procedure also handles refund checks for students for whom you received third party payments and determines whether a refund check is printed for the third party, the student, or both.  Once the refund invoices are created, A/R refund checks can be printed. The checks are written to students using an ID Number of 999999999 (9 nines); however, their name and address still appear on the check.

Per IRS regulations, ALL current calendar year transactions marked 1098-T eligible must appear on the 1098-T form for that year. Transaction history data is extracted based on the transaction date and 1098-T eligibility flag. Once the data has been retrieved, the year and term begin and end dates determine the amounts.  1098-Ts are typically generated in January for the previous calendar year; however, they can be created at any time for one or more individuals. Due dates are usually January 31 for the paper report and February 28 for magnetic media output.  1098 - T Year   Select the year you want to run the 1098-T report.  Generate Media   Choose this checkbox if you want the report to generate a Magnetic Media file.  Destination   When you select the Generate Media checkbox, you must click the destination icon to determine where the Magnetic Media file will save.

If you do not have any warnings, you will not see a Warning Listing Report.

The automatic transfer method is easier to use, but you do not have as much control over the transfer, and it does not allow you to track the transferred charges with an invoice number.  The automatic transfer method allows you to generate the third party charges during the Student Charges process. To define the charges you want to be transferred, select the   Apply To Third Party   checkbox on the   Charges Definition/Charges Detail Entry   window.  If the student being charged has a third party associated with them and the charge is defined to be applied to the third party, the full charge amount will be transferred to the third party.  The third party's charge is in a separate subsidiary account so that the student's subsidiary account is credited and the charges are put on the third party’s subsidiary account.

EX Accounts Receivable Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  111  H ISTORY   R EGISTER  The History Register report will allow you to  print all Accounts Receivable account transactions that have a status of History.  Before printing the register, you should check the Subsidiary Control table, which allows you to control balances or groups of students that will be printed on the register.  This report is going out and taking all activity from a student all the way back to when the student was entered into the system.  Many times, the Accounts Receivable report is used in place of this report because it offers more flexibility.  When the History Register Report is generated, a temporary lock is created in the database. When the report is successfully displayed or printed, the lock in the database is released.
