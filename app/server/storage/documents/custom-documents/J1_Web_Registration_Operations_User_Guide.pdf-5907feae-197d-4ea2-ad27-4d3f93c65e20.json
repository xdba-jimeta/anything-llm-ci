To process reports, filter for the term and for the 'Submitted' status. Then sort the list by Attendance Type. J1 Web 2020.1 – Registration Operations User Guide   13  P   ROCESSING THE   R   EPORTS  Processing the reports means approving or denying them, and, as appropriate, dropping or withdrawing students from courses.  Checkpoint reports are view-only. Processing them is scheduled for a future release.  You process Census Date reports one type at a time, either Never Attended or No Longer Attending, so you select the students with one of those types. In the   Options   drop-down, you select that type, and enter the Status and other information in the pop-up window. There may be default data in the fields, but you can change it. Then repeat the process for students with the other type.  If you select   Dropped   for the Status, you must enter a Drop Date. J1 Web 2020.1 – Registration Operations User Guide   14  If you select   Withdrawn , you must enter a Drop Date, a Withdrawal Date, and a Withdrawal Grade. J1 Web 2020.1 – Registration Operations User Guide   15  You can assign a withdrawal grade only to a single grading type at a time. If your list includes students with different grading types, use the filter to find students with the same grading type.  U   NDERSTANDING THE   S   TATUSES  Statuses indicate the results of attendance reporting at any given moment. Checkpoint reports' status is the same as their Attendance Type. That is, Attended or Did Not Attend. The registrar doesn't process these any further. For Census Date reports, the 'Submitted' status indicates a report ready for you to process. In the processing, you assign a status of 'Denied', 'Dropped', or 'Withdrawn'.  Status   Category   How Set   Details  Attended,  Did Not Attend  Checkpoint   Automatically   Instructor selects either of these as an attendance type. It automatically becomes the status, as well.  Submitted   Census Date   Automatically  Instructor submits any type of census date report. Status automatically becomes 'Submitted'. The Registrar then processes submitted reports.

For more information, contact your module manager or your campus support team.  Use this page to register students when they can't register themselves. You can also drop or withdraw students from sections, update their course enrollment status, or contact students. You can work with one student or with multiple students at once.  The Student Registration page roughly mirrors the J1 Desktop Student Registration window, mostly on the Registration tab | Register subtab and Student Course Details subtab.  B   UILD A   W   ORKING   L   IST  The first thing to do on this page is build the list of students you want to work with. You can populate the list by entering students' names or IDs one at a time, or you can filter down from all students. You can even use both methods together, adding some students to the list individually and others by filtering down.  You can add multiple filters, so, for example, you could filter for art majors whose GPA in Spring 2017 was 0 to 1.9. Or you could filter for students whose Group Reg Code is Cohort 16 who are off their academic plan.  For some filters, you can select multiple values. For example, in the Major filter, if you select Art and Art Education, you'll see the Art majors and the Art Education majors.

R   EGISTER   S   TUDENTS  Register the selected students for a section in the selected term. Enter a few characters of the section code to bring up a list of matching sections. (For example, to find Art 1001-02, you could enter \"Ar\", \"1001\", or \"1-02\".) You select the section and set the enrollment status. J1 Web 2020.1 – Registration Operations User Guide   20  If you decide not to register one of the students, click the   Remove   icon in their row.  REGISTRATION OVERRIDES  If any students have registration issues such as a schedule conflict, a message informs you. If an override is possible (such as for repeat course issues and holds), the Registration Overrides window pops up automatically with a list of students and errors. You can override issues several ways:  •   To override issues for only a single section for an individual student, click   Override section .  •   To override issues for all listed sections for an individual student, click   Override student .  •   To override issues for all listed sections for all listed students, click   Override all . J1 Web 2020.1 – Registration Operations User Guide   21  If you close the Registration Overrides pop-up leaving some issues unresolved, you can still grant overrides for any of those students by clicking the   Action   button and selecting   Registration override . When you grant an override, a confirmation message lets you know whether the override was successful. If it was, the student is now registered for the course.  The   Registration override   action is inactive if none of the students requires an override.  COREQUISITES  If the course has corequisites, a message notifies you. Click in the   Add Corequisite   field to see the corequisite group (that is, the list of sections of all courses that satisfy the corequisite). You can select the same corequisite for all students or select a different one for each student.  By default, if a student is already registered for any section of the corequisite group, they won't be registered for the section you select. But you can deselect the checkbox for that default.

Dropped courses aren't counted as repeats.  •   The   State Funded   field resets to the value on the section in the Courses window (Section Master).  •   The   Unfunded Reason   field resets to null.

(Each student receives an individually addressed identical email, not a group email.) You can include a salutation (such as \"Dear\") in the   Personalized Greeting   field. The email message will then read, for example, \"Dear Saad\". A message alerts you if any selected students are missing an email address.  R   EMOVE   S   TUDENTS FROM THE   L   IST  You can remove one or more students from the working list. (Doing so merely means you won't be working on their records right now; it doesn't drop them from courses.)

When you move students to a new section, you can select an option for what to do with the old section.  •   Delete it (so it doesn't show in the student's course history)  •   Drop it (so it appears as a dropped course)  •   Keep it (so the student is enrolled in both) J1 Web 2020.1 – Registration Operations User Guide   26  After you click   Done , a confirmation message appears.

In either the   Options   or the   Actions   drop-down, select   Update Enrollment Status .  Why can't I see the \"Update enrollment status\" option in the Action and Option drop-downs?  It may be because you don't have permission edit any student course history records. The setting is on the Registration Permissions window in J1 Desktop.

We try to be clear in documentation by saying something like \"student self-withdrawal\", but in narrow columns on a J1 Desktop window, we sometimes use the briefer \"student withdrawal\".

Instead, click on a student's name anywhere to open the student's summary page. From there, in the Person-Student drop-down, select   Student  |   Student   |   Manage student holds .  In the J1 Desktop application, Holds are handled in the Student Holds window.  FAQ  What's the difference between removing a hold and deleting it?  Removing a hold means setting the End Date to expire the hold, making it ineffective or inactive. (It could be reactivated later by setting a later End Date.) Deleting a hold means deleting it completely from the system.  What's the difference between the Add Date and the Start Date?  The Add Date is when the hold was created in the system. The Start Date is when the hold first becomes effective. Thus, a registrar can add a hold today, but make it effective beginning on a date in the future or in the past.  What's the difference between a Remove Date and an End Date?  The Remove Date is the date the registrar took action to set End Date. The End Date is when the hold is no longer effective. Thus, a registrar can take action today (so today is the Remove Date) but make the hold ineffective beginning on another date in the future or the past (and that date is the End Date).

Deleting a section completely removes the record. Do it when the course was added to the student's record by mistake.  Dropping a section removes it from the student's transcript, but a record of it remains in the student's course history.  Withdrawn courses appear on a student's transcript.
