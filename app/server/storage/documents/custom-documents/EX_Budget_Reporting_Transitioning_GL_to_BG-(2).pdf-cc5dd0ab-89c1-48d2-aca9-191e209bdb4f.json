While the operating budget is created through the Budget module, you can also use the other products to regulate the spending of allocated funds.  When a purchase order or transaction is entered, spending is confirmed through the Budget module, tracked against the respective General Ledger accounts, and related warnings or messages will be delivered in the Purchasing or Payroll module.  A critical concept to understand is that functions performed in other products will  directly impact   the operating budget that has been established in Budget.  Some of the features of the Budget module include the following:     Automate pre-defined notification events to keep everyone informed of budget changes including budget officer assignments, submissions, adjustments, and approvals     Build complex budget roll-ups and approval hierarchies by creating worksheets supporting unlimited budget officers     Allow budget officers to set up portions of the budget themselves and assign others as needed     Quickly begin the budget process each year by copying the prior year budget roll-ups, approval hierarchies, and budget officer assignments     Collaborate with others in a secure environment that can be accessed from anywhere     Expedite the budget build with electronic approvals and instant notifications and a clear audit trail     From anywhere, see all of the budget worksheets, their current status, and who currently has them within the process   –   at a single glance     Send worksheets back to multiple budget officers at one with bulk feedback when similar changes are needed     Export all or portions of the budget into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet EX Quick Guide: Budget  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v el o pm e nt  5  S ETTING   U P A   B UDGET  There are several steps that need to be followed in the appropriate sequential order to be sure that your budget is properly established.  The Setup and Manage Budgets window consists of sever al tabs   –   by following them from left to right, you will be led to the next step within the sequence.

A user must be assigned to a worksheet role in order to access their associated worksheets in EX and the budget portlet.  When all of the appropriate permissions and roles have been granted, you will be able to view all of the details on the worksheet and drill down into transactions if necessary.  Budget User Checklist     Users must exist in the Name Master table and the Notification Enabled checkbox needs to be selected on the Name Entity window     Users must be assigned a valid EX ID number     Users must belong to a valid group with the Notification Enabled checkbox selected     User group must be assigned account access in the General Ledger (account security)  This will determine if the user can view drill down information (transaction details) for the budget actual figures  If a user is a member of more than one group, the highest level of permissions will be granted  If you only want users to view information,   this can be done through the  budget portlet.     User must choose notification preferences in the Common module and also in the contact profile preferences option     User must be granted the appropriate worksheet role in the Budget module EX Quick Guide: Budget   8  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v el o pm e nt  S ETTING   U P   W ORKSHEET   R OLES  In order for a person to be able to access the budget module, you will need to be sure that the necessary permissions have been granted to that user.  This can be done through worksheet roles. Each role is pre-defined with capabilities that will be available to any person who is assigned to that specific role. This process makes it easy for you to determine which person will be allowed to perform certain functions and then you can assign the respective role to that person.  The table below will provide you with a full description of the ability a person will have when assigned to the respective role.  Role   Description  Administrators   Creates the master budget, creates worksheets, assigns General Ledger accounts and/or line items to budget  User in this role do not have access to the budget capabilities that are available in the budget portlet  Viewer   Views worksheets  Can view worksheets in Preparation status as well as Board Approved  Can add comments or attachments  Proposed   Budget  Preparer  Enters budget amounts  Cen estimate and calculate amounts, update amounts as needed, and submit worksheet using EX and/or budget portlet  Proposed Budget  Approver  Reviews and approves or denies worksheets during budget preparation using EX and/or budget portlet  Will receive notification when the worksheet is ready to be approved  Transfer  Submitter  Submits, updates, and cancels transfers from respective worksheets  Can recommend moving amounts from one line item to another within worksheets but cannot increase the overall board approved budget  Transfer Approver   Creates, changes, cancels, and approves transfers  Can approve transfer requests using EX and/or the budget portlet  Transfers MOVE budget amounts EX Quick Guide: Budget  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v el o pm e nt  9  Adjustment  Submitter  Submits, updates, and cancels budget transfers and modifications  Can request transfers and request increases to board approved budgets  Adjustment  Approver  Creates, updates, and approves budget transfers and modifications  Can increase board approved budget through request approvals or actually make changes to the budget  Adjustments CHANGE budgets  Spending  Supervisor  Views worksheets to determine how much budget has been spent, how much remains, and spending transfers  Can only access worksheets in the board approved status using EX and/or the budget portlet EX Quick Guide: Budget   10  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v el o pm e nt  U NDERSTANDING   B UDGET   S TATUS  There is a difference between the status of a budget and the status of a worksheet. So you might have a budget that is in the Preparation status while one or more worksheets associated with the budget are in the Setting Up status.  Depending on the status of your budget, you will be able to perform certain tasks. You will find 5 categories for the budget status. Only the administrator can change the status of a budget.  Status   Description  Setup   Automatically assigned when the budget is initially created  During this status, the worksheets are being created, budget amounts cannot be entered, and the budget is not visible on the Budget Portlet yet  Preparation   Budget and worksheets are being created  Line items and General Ledger accounts have been identified  Budget officers have been assigned  Budget can be made available for entering and updating amounts  Under Board  Review  Worksheets have been submitted for review  Worksheets must be approved before submitted for review and cannot be modified during the review process  Board Approved   Budget has been approved and spending can take place (budget checking will begin if this configuration has been selected)  Changes can only be made through the adjustments process  If the budget is not approved, it will re-enter the Preparation status  Retired   Budget year has ended  Budget cannot be modified in any way EX Quick Guide: Budget  J e nz ab ar L ea rn in g & De v el o pm e nt  11  T ROUBLESHOOTING  Budget officers cannot see worksheets  1   Go to Setup and Manage Budgets window and click on the Assign Budget Officers tab  2   Choose the worksheet that the person should be able to view  3   Verify that their name is selected as the budget officer and choose the appropriate role  4   Click the icon to assign the budget officer permission to the worksheet  5   Verify that the worksheet has been made available to the budget officer (click the Make Worksheet Available icon from the Setup Worksheets tab on the Setup and Manage Budget window)  If   this last step is not done, the worksheet will not be available from the portlet.  Other budgets are not available from the drop-down field on the Setup and Manage Budgets window  If you are not an administrator, you will not be able to choose other budgets from the drop-down list. Only administrators who have also been granted function security to this window will be able to choose other budgets.  Transaction details are not displayed  While you will be able to see the line item, you will only be able to drill down into the actual figures if you have been granted the appropriate general ledger security for that specific account number.  Historical data is missing after moving line items from one worksheet to a new worksheet  1   Select the new worksheet from the hierarchy  2   Select the Display Line Items radio button in the bottom right section of the window  3   Check the Select box for each line item that will be moved to the new worksheet  4   Click the green Up arrow to move the line items to the worksheet  Remember   that you are not actually moving general ledger accounts but line items  from one worksheet to another.  Historical data is missing after copying a budget from one year to a new year  During the copy process, after entering the start and end date for the new budget, be sure that you select the   Relate to Prior Year Budget   checkbox so that historical data will be displayed when you are using the enter budget column.
