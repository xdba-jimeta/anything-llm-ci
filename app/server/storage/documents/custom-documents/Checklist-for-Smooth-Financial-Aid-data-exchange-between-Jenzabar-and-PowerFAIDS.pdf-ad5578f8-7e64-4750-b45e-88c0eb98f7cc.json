Advising Master   -   All students must have Advising Master records. Without and Advising Master record,  no AIMS can be assigned. There is a Data Quality Completeness and Consistency check for this that is  available on the Executive Dashboard.   NSC_All_Probs_By_Student_ADV_Bucket  Synchronize Advisee Information   -   Use this window to update advisee information. Synchronizing clears  out all selected advisee information and rebuilds it based on the most recent information in the Student  Division Master and Degree History tables. This process is typically only run w hen your school initially  goes live with EX and has mock data from testing or when you need to start over with advising  information for an advisee or group of advisees . Francine ran this tool on a regular basis with these  se ttings. AIMS   -   AIMS are assigned manually quite frequently. However, Synchronize Advisee Information will do  it en masse. All students must have AIMS assigned to them. Without AIMS, no student progress can be  calculated.   In general, AIMS can be assigned manually or by running the Synchronize Advisee  Information tool. There is also a Data Quality Completeness and Consistency check in place to catch  problems with Student Aims not matching the Degree and Advising Tree Year   code. It is included in the  NSC_All_Probs_By_Student_ADV_Bucket   report.  Student Progress Locks   –   Sometimes have to be cleared.   You should always check this first when a  student’s progress does not seem to be calculating correctly (i.e. the advising worksheet looks wrong).  Compute Student Progress   -   Student_Progress is an input to Credit Hours Update. If no student  progress is available, the enrollment hours will not be calculated for transfer to PowerFAIDs.   This is  typically kept up to date by the Jenzabar Client Application services, but sometimes that service goes  down and there are lots of students who require student progress calculations. This is the window you  can use to perform the Student Progress C alculations “manually”. Advising Configuration   –   This window lets you see how many students currently require Student  Progress recalculations. In this example, there are none because the automated process is working.  Part Time/Full Time Update  This window is used to update the total hours, total count, part time/full time hours, and part time/full  time status on the Student Master, Student Term   Summary, and Student Term Summary by Division  tables. You can run the PT/FT Update process for one student or multiple students for selected years  and terms or all years and terms. The year and term selections determine which rows from the Student  Term Sum mary table will be selected for the Update process. This   would be considered a process run by the Registrar’s office at most schools. However, it is not  outside the realm of possibility for the Financial Aid office to be in charge of keeping this up to date.  It is interesting to note that it appears this process has never been incorporated into the Recalculate  Academic Record process which handles all other enrollment summary table entries. As such, all  schools must ensure that this process is run manually.   At every school, the best option is to only run the  tool on students where the Student_Crs_Hist and summary tables are out of synch. I have developed a  query that detects this condition for use as a selection set: d_pt_ft_select_out_of_synch [as shown in  the previous illustration]. The syntax of that query is as follows.  WITH   All_Years_Terms_Enrolled_STSD   AS  ( SELECT   stsd . ID_NUM ,   ytt . yr_cde ,   ytt . TRM_CDE ,   stsd . Div_cde ,   stsd .

TRANSACTION_STS   NOT   in   ( 'D' ,   'W' )  GROUP   BY  sch . ID_NUM ,   ytt . yr_cde ,   sch . Transcript_Div ,   ytt . TRM_CDE ,   ytt . trm_begin_Dte  )  SELECT  distinct  student_crs_hist . id_num ,  name_format_view . last_first_middle_suf  FROM  All_Years_Terms_Enrolled_SCH   AS   a  LEFT   OUTER   JOIN   All_Years_Terms_Enrolled_STSD   as   b   ON   b . id_num   =   a .

TRM_CDE   and   a . transcript_div   =   b . div_cde  JOIN   name_format_view   ON   name_format_view . id_num   =   a . id_num  JOIN   student_crs_hist   ON   student_crs_hist . id_num   =   name_format_view . id_num  WHERE  a . hrs_enrolled   <>   b . hrs_enrolled  or  b . id_num   is   null  The remedy is to run the   Part Time/Full Time Update tool   with No Years/Terms selected.  I have also created a DQCC view that traps this problem and instructs the report viewer how to remedy  the problem. That view definition follows:  USE   [TmsEPrd]  GO /****** Object:   View [dbo].[DQCC_Need_To_Run_PTFT_Update_Tool]   Script Date: 11/11/2020 2:16:31 PM  ******/  SET   ANSI_NULLS   OFF  GO  SET   QUOTED_IDENTIFIER   OFF  GO  --   DQCC means Data Quality Completeness and Consistency  ALTER   view   [dbo] . [ DQCC_Need_To_Run_PTFT_Update_Tool]  AS  /*  As students add and drop classes, the PT/FT Status needs to be updated.   RCC has a long history of  allowing the summary  tables to get out of synch.   They have not been consistent in running the PT/FT Status Update tool.  This query identifies the fact that the summary tables are out of synch with the Student_Crs_Hist records.  Any records  identified by this query can be \"fixed\" by running the PT/FT Status Update tool with all years and terms  removed  from the criteria, and the following query selected from the drop - down window.  REREPORT.pbl | d_pt_ft_select_out_of_synch  The success and accuracy of this report is dependent on Student_Crs_Hist.Transcript_Div   being correct at  all times.   There is a  SP run every day to ensure that this is the case.   The SP is named,  RCC_DQCC_Align_SCH_To_CM_Division_Codes.   If the job that runs  this SP is failing, this query will not really work.

I believe that Lerick runs this on a routine basis, but we do not have any Data  Quality Completeness and Consistency checks built for this. The Match Records tool pretty much  provides that functionality.  Credit Hours Update   -   Use this window to calculate enrollment data on students for the selected POE  and to run the Credit Hours Update Report and the optional Drop/Add Report from the Financial Aid  Master table.   This tool must be run prior to running the Create Student Update for Financial Aid tool. Calculate Satisfactory Progress   -   PFMANAGERs have access to this tool. SAP, SAP1, SAP2, SAP3 update  rules are in play. I believe that Laura Biechler and Thomas Frazier did a lot of work on these about a  year ago. I have not validated the rules first hand. Satisfactory Progress (towar ds a degree) can be  checked either at the end of each term (POE) or annually, at the end of an award year. Calculate  Satisfactory Progress evaluates all students registered either in a specific year or term, depending on  your configuration, and populates r ows in the Satisfactory Progress History table, which is designed to  hold all evaluation elements and results.   This tool should be run after grades are entered at the end of  each semester. The results of this run are included in the data feed to PowerFAIDS (as long as the  checkbox is checked within the Financial Aid configuration window.)  Create Student Update for Financial Aid   –   This should be run frequently prior to the census date, then  one final time after the census date has passed. This is a recurring process for every semester. This  process can be automated, but RCC has not gotten to that point yet. Every time this tool   is run, you  must also run the External Data tool from within PowerFAIDS to ensure the data makes it into the FA  system. External Update Import Wizard   -   This tool needs to be run every time the Create Student Update for  Financial Aid tool is run in Jenzabar. Now the data is in PowerFAIDS and in all the right locations in PowerFAIDS... Awards are made.  Students accept awards, etc.  Going back to Jenzabar...  Subsidiary Control   -   The Business Office must set the Period End Date in order for the transactions on  student accounts to show correctly on MyRCC. If the transactions have a date later than the Period End  Date, they will not show on the Students Billing Statement. Anticipated Aid   –   This is a tool in Jenzabar that brings over Preliminary Financial Aid from PowerFAIDS  to the Student Account. It is very important that this be done on a regular basis so that students can see  what their anticipated aid is and how it affects their acco unt balance.   This can also be scheduled to run  at specific times.  Export Wizard Disbursment Authorization   –   This is how disbursement roster files are generated in  PowerFAIDS. Learning to use this tool is a project in itself. Disbursements and Adjustments   –   This is the tool in Jenzabar that reads in the Disbursement Rosters  that are generated out of PowerFAIDS. It must be run any time you are satisfied that a “Real”  disbursement is ready to be   credited to students accounts. Anticipated Aid   -   After an actual disbursement is made, the FA office needs to run Anticipated Aid one  more time in order to clear out the Preliminary Credits to the student’s account.",
