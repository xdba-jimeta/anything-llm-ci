In general, most definitions must already be configured in J1 Desktop; once they are, getting started with J1 Web Registration is a seamless process. Processes and fields largely retain the same name as in J1 Desktop, so users will find a new, yet familiar, way to complete tasks.  This guide provides an overview of how to set up and begin to use J1 Web Registration features. It is intended for module manages and IT administrators who will be implementing J1 Web Registration for our campus, as well as administrative users who will manage processes such as setting up and managing courses, students, and faculty or designating user roles and permissions.  J1 Web Registration encompasses several different hubs:  •   Academic Department Hub - Allows registrars to view all courses for all instructors.  •   Faculty Hub - Allows instructors to view and manage their courses.  •   Registration Administration Hub   - Allows high-level users to create catalog courses and sections, assign roles, and set up features for students, faculty, and registrars.  •   Registration Operations Hub - Registration office staff use this hub for registrar tasks, like enrolling and registering students, managing student information, and processing reported attendance.

A   SSIGN   J1   D   ESKTOP   R   EGISTRATION   P   ERMISSIONS   G   ROUP  Before being able to register a student, the user must belong to a Registration Permissions Group in J1 Desktop. This can be managed in the J1 Desktop Registration Permissions window and the Group Definition window.  Users who will be responsible for registering students must be added to a Registration Permissions Group in J1 Desktop. These groups can be created and managed Group Definition window in J1 Desktop. This is also where you can add users to the group. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   10  After the group is created, make sure to add it to the Registration Permissions window in J1 Desktop. This window contains more registration-specific permissions.  C   ONNECT   T   HE   JICS   C   AMPUS   P   ORTAL TO   J1   W   EB  Adding the ApiRoot to your campus portal's ERP Settings allows for features or modules in the campus portal and J1 Web to communicate and correctly map data from one application to the other. This step is optional. However, you will need to perform this step if you are going to utilize the integration between J1 Web Events and JICS campus portal features such as FormFlow - Forms, the Event Requests feature, or if you plan on publishing J1 Web events to JICS campus portal calendars.  H   OW   T   O  Connect the JICS Campus Portal to J1 Web  This configuration sets up the connection between J1 Web and the campus portal. This configuration only needs to be completed once and should suffice for all future web service needs.  1.   Log into the JICS campus portal as an administrator.  2.   From the profile drop-down options, select   Site Manager . The Site Manager page appears and displays the   Site Settings   tab. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   11  3.   Click   ERP Settings   from the sidebar menu. The   ERP settings   page appears.  4.   In the   J1 API Root   field, enter the correct web API root.  To get your school's API root, take your school's J1 Web URL and add   /api to the end of the URL. For example, if your school's J1 Web URL is http://AnywhereUniversity.net/J1Web, the API root will be http://AnywhereUniversity.net/J1Web /api  5.   Click   Save .  U   SING   R   OLES TO   C   ONTROL   U   SER   A   CCESS  Make sure you have   set users up in J1 Desktop   before assigning roles and permissions in J1 Web.  Roles determine what users can and cannot do in J1 Web. Each role has specific privileges to different features and information available to those users assigned to it. Jenzabar provides standardized 'role templates' for each module. These templates can be copied and tailored to create new roles with varying permissions to control different levels of access. For example, you can set roles up according to your school's organizational or departmental hierarchy. Roles can have multiple users assigned to them and a user can belong to multiple roles.  You can add users to a role by using the Manage Registration Roles page, or you can add roles to a user’s permissions by using the Manage System Users page in the System Administration hub.  Before a user can manage J1 Web Registration roles, a System Administrator must give them permission. The easiest way to do this is to add them to the role of Registration Module Manager.  When planning your user roles, think about what information each user will need access to. A registrar will likely need the ability to create and grant overrides, whereas other faculty may not need to be able to do that. Who will need to be able to create and edit courses and sections?  R   EGISTRATION   R   OLES  Use this page to view roles for the registration module. With proper permissions, you can jump to pages where you can edit, copy, or create registration roles. Editing allows you to add or remove users to the role and to change the role's permissions. Creating and Copying are ways of creating a new role based J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   12  on a selected template. You can change the name and description, and you can change the role's permissions.  Remember that each of these roles may be copied and modified for customized roles.  If the original role's permissions are changed in a future release, then any roles created or copied from that template will automatically inherit the new changes.  C   REATE  When you create a new role, you choose a default role for a template. All the permissions are deselected to begin with, and you select the permissions you want assigned to the role. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   13  C   OPY  Copying could save you time over creating because when you copy an existing role, the permissions are selected in the new role just as they were in the one you copied from. You can then edit the selections as you wish. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   14  F   ILTERING THE   R   OLES  You can filter the list of registration roles as you can many lists. Two of the criteria are especially interesting. With Default vs. Copied Roles, you can limit the list to only original roles or to ones your school has created. With Versions, you can see when roles were created or last updated. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   15  D   EFAULT ROLES  These roles are available by default. With proper permissions, you can use the default roles to copy and create new roles, customize the permissions in those roles, and assign users.  Course Information – Access to All Courses J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   16  •   Any user needing access to course information for all courses offered at your school. Includes roster, grade, and override information.  Department Head Course Access  •   Department heads accessing courses and the related faculty and students. Access granted according to the course code’s department.  Faculty – Access to Courses and Students by Course  •   Faculty managing their course loads and rosters. Features for supporting and advising students enrolled in their courses are also available.  Registrars  •   Registrars and individuals working in the registrar’s office who need to access student and course information, and perform registration tasks.  Registration – Access to All Students  •   Registrars and high-level administrators such as presidents and deans of students who need to view information on individual students such as holds, financial aid status, test scores, programs, graduation status, course list, and retention score.  Registration Module Manager  •   Administrative users managing Registration roles and settings.  H   OW   T   O  Filter the Roles  Use the System Roles Filter to narrow the list of roles that appear. You can filter by keywords, default or copied roles, or by the version that the role was last updated.  Create a New Role  Create or Copy a New Registration Role  You can make a new role using the Create Role Wizard, or by copying an existing role. In both cases you can customize the permissions available to each role.  Create a New Role Based on a Default Role Template  Use the create role feature to create a new registration role based on the Jenzabar-provided default role templates. The wizard steps you through selecting the template and determining what permissions will be available with the role.  1.   Select the Create Role button.  2.   Choose the default template you want to use for the new role. Give it a unique name, and modify the description.  3.   Customize the permissions for this role and save.  Copy and Modify a Role  Use the copy role feature to create a new registration role based on any existing role. The wizard steps you through selecting the template and determining what permissions will be available with the role. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   17  1.   On the row for the role you want to copy, click Options and select Copy.  2.   Give the role a unique name, and modify the description.  3.   Customize the permissions for this role and save.  For more information about managing roles, see the System Administration Online Help.  FAQ  What's the difference between creating a role and copying a role?  Whether you create a new role or copy an existing one, you select an existing role to use as a template. However, there are key differences between creating and copying.  •   Availability: You can copy any role, but only default roles can be used as templates for creating new roles.  •   Permissions: When you copy, all permissions are copied in their current state, but when you create, no permissions are selected. In each case, you can select and deselect permissions in the new role.  R   EGISTRATION   S   ETTINGS  Information and features vary according to the roles to which you belong and the permissions associated with those roles. For more information, contact your module manager or your campus support team.  Settings on this page control J1 Web and campus portal features used by students, faculty, and the registration office. Use the Navigation bar to go directly to a feature's settings.  Because the settings may have an impact on many users, each setting has instructions and reminders on the Registration Settings page.  C   OURSE   S   EARCH   F   ILTER  The course search filter helps faculty and staff search for courses on various J1 Web screens and blocks, including the Course Center block and the Course List page, as well as the My Course Center block and the My Course List page. The settings here let you expand the definition of an active course and allow you to restrict the numbers of years available in searches to users in most roles. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   18  A   CTIVE   C   OURSES  Searchers may want to filter for courses that are currently in session, or what might be called active courses. But it might be helpful to extend the definition of active courses to include a certain number of days before the course begins and after it ends. Here you can extend the days before and the days after independently of each other.  A   CADEMIC   Y   EARS  You can limit the number of past and future academic years available in course searches. The limits apply to most roles. However, users in roles based on either the Registrars or the Course Access roles can be given access to all academic years. The current academic year is always available in course searches.  S   TUDENT   R   EGISTRATION   F   EATURE  The Student Registration feature in the campus portal replaces the Add/Drop feature. It allows all students to develop their schedules using a planning calendar. If they have an academic plan, it guides them to courses in their plan. If they don't have a plan but have a degree audit, it guides them to courses that meet their remaining requirements. If they have neither an academic plan nor degree audit, they use a general course search to place courses on their planning calendars.  From the planning calendar, students can try various schedules, resolve schedule conflicts, take care of holds, get approvals and clearances, and pay for must-pay courses. The search and calendar have links to contact the course instructor or the student's advisor. When they're ready, students can register for courses directly from the calendar.  Off : All students register using the Add/Drop feature. The planning calendar is not available, and students are not guided toward courses that fit their academic plan or meet their degree requirements.  On : All students register using the Student Registration feature. All students can use the planning calendar. Students are guided by their academic plan or degree audit if they have them.  Days Before Add/Drop to Open My Schedule Calendar Tool:   Set the number of days before each registration period that students can begin searching courses and using the planning calendar for the next term. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   19  The Student Registration Feature setting must be on in order for students to use the planning calendar and for their course searches to be guided by their academic plans or degree audits.  The Student Registration Feature setting appears on both the Registration Settings and the Advising Settings page.  S   WITCHING TO   J1   W   EB   G   RADE   E   NTRY AND   O   VERRIDES  J1 Web features a grade entry page and a course overrides authorizations feature that will replace the corresponding features on the campus portal. The result is a more integrated, smoother workflow.  These J1 Web features require some setup before making the switch. See   Switching to J1 Web Grade Entry and Overrides   for important information about setting up for the switch.  When you switch to using J1 Web for any of these features, the feature is no longer available in the campus portal. A message on the campus portal appears where the feature used to be, and it directs the user to J1 Web.  G   RADE   E   NTRY   M   ESSAGES AND   T   ASKS  These settings let you automatically send your faculty reminders and a task guiding them to enter grades each grading period. You can edit the text of the messages and the task, and you can decide when they should be sent. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   20  By default, the messages and the task are set to ON. The first message is set to send 72 hours before the grading period opens. The reminder message is set to send 10 hours before the grading period closes.  C   ONTACTS  Here you set up contacts in the registrar's office for faculty to contact with concerns about registration and grade entry. You can tag them as Attendance Reporting, Grade Entry, or Registrar contacts. Grade Entry contacts are notified when a course's grades aren't entered by the end of a grading period. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   21  D   ROP AND   W   ITHDRAW   S   TUDENT   S   ECTIONS  Use these settings to set defaults for drops and withdrawals on the Student Registration page and on a student's Sections list page. (From a student's summary page, select 'Student' in the Person-Student drop-down, and then select 'Student section list'.)  D   EFAULT   D   ATES  You can set the defaults for drop and withdrawal dates. Your school defines the choices available which might include the first day of class, the day before that, the Friday before the first day, and the last date of attendance. You can also enter a date manually. In addition, for the default withdrawal date, you can default to the date the course was dropped. No matter which you select as the default, when a registrar drops a student section, they can still change the option for that instance.  D   EFAULT   D   ROP   F   LAG  You can set the default for the drop flag. 'Drop' means that by default, every dropped course will have the Drop Flag on. 'None\" means that by default, no dropped course will have the Drop Flag on. No matter which you select as the default, when a registrar drops a student section, they can still change the Drop Flag to either 'Drop' or 'None'.  The dropped course will have an enrollment status of 'Dropped' regardless of the Drop Flag's value.  D   EFAULT   W   ITHDRAWAL   R   EASON  You can select a default to populate the Withdrawal Reason when a registrar withdraws a student. The registrar can change the reason.  D   EFAULT   W   ITHDRAWAL   G   RADE  You can select a default to populate the Withdrawal Grade when a registrar withdraws a student. The registrar can change the grade.  A   TTENDANCE   R   EPORTING  Attendance reporting helps your school manage retention by tracking when students aren't attending classes. You can set up several kinds of reports and have faculty automatically receive tasks to complete the reports.  B   ACKGROUND   I   NFORMATION ABOUT   A   TTENDANCE   R   EPORTING  There are two categories of attendance reporting, Checkpoint and Census Date. You can turn on either or both, or you can leave them both turned off. You can edit the display names for both the Checkpoint and Census Date categories. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   22  Instructors submit their attendance reporting in the Faculty hub on the Attendance page for each of their courses. Registrars then process the reports on the Reported Attendance page in the Registration hub, dropping or withdrawing students from courses as needed.  C   HECKPOINT   R   EPORTS  Checkpoint reports allow faculty to report who is present for specified class meetings, such as the 1st meeting or the 5th. Registrars can create as many checkpoint reports as you need.  C   ENSUS   D   ATE   R   EPORTS  The Census Date category tells who is attending as of the census date. One type reports those who have never attended, and another type who is no longer attending.  S   ETTINGS FOR   A   TTENDANCE   R   EPORTING  There are a number of settings for Census Date reports besides turning the category on and off or renaming it. For each of the types, Never Attended and No Longer Attending, you can turn on and off both Drop and Withdrawal. You can also set default values for Drop Date, Withdrawal Date, and Withdrawal Grade. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   23  You can't have both Drop and Withdrawal set to 'Off' for a type that's 'On'. These are the default settings for Drop and Withdrawal:  •   Never Attended  o   Drop: on  o   Withdrawal: off  •   No Longer Attending  o   Drop: off  o   Withdrawal: on  E   XCLUDING   I   NDIVIDUAL   C   OURSES AND   S   ECTIONS FROM   A   TTENDANCE R   EPORTING  If you want to exclude particular courses from Census Date reporting, Checkpoint reporting, or both, you can do that on the Manage Course Details page.

(You create the categories and levels on the CBE Category Level Definition window.)  R   EQUIRED OR   O   PTIONAL   ?  You can make competencies optional or, instead, required by default for course completion. (Then, as you assign competencies to courses and sections in J1 Web, you can accept or override the default.)  G   RADES   ,   C   REDITS   ,   AND   H   OURS  You can decide whether CBE elements have grades, credits, and hours. You also decide whether grades, credits, and hours roll up from the CBE elements to the student's course grade. (For grades, you're setting the defaults for newly created courses and sections, but users can change the settings for individual courses, sections, and student course history records.)  Should competencies have their own grades, credits, and hours? That depends on how your school wants to use competencies. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   54  Competencies as Mere Badges  You   can set up CBE so that competencies are merely like badges—acknowledgements of skills achieved. In that case, the CBE elements themselves don't have grades, credits, or hours. To use CBE this way, when you're setting up CBE on the Registration Configuration window, don't opt in to grading, credits, and hours on CBE.  Competencies as the Focus of a Course or Section  If you want competencies fully integrated, with each CBE competency getting a grade, hours, and/or credits, then opt in to those settings on the Registration Configuration window.  You can have grades, credits, and/or hours roll up from the CBE elements to the section. The student's grade, credits, and/or hours for the section (as seen in the student's course history) result from the student's grade, credits, and/or hours in each of the CBE elements.  If you don't want grades to roll up, you can have them roll down. The instructor grades the course, and each required CBE element is automatically assigned that same grade.  If you don't want credits and/or hours to roll up, then the individual CBE elements won't have hours and/or credits assigned to them. They're assigned only to the student course record for the section.  G   RADING   M   ETHOD  Decide the defaults for CBE grading: do CBE elements get graded? If they do get graded, do their grades roll up to determine the student's section grade, or does the section grade roll down to each of the CBE elements?  If \"Allow grading on CBE\" is deselected: CBE elements don't get graded.  Grades roll up: If the student earns an A on Competency 1, a B on Competency 2, and a C on Competency 3 (and those competencies are required), then the student's section grade is a B, the average of the 3 competencies.  Grades roll down: If the student earns a C+ in the course, they automatically earn a C+ on each of the required competencies, too.  These are merely default settings for when courses and sections get created. Users with permission can change the settings for each course, section, and student course record.  C   REDITS  Decide whether to use credits for CBE elements. If so, do their credits roll up to determine the section credits?  If \"Use credits on CBE elements\" is deselected: CBE elements don't get credits.  If \"Credits roll up from CBE elements\" is selected: If the student earns 1 credit on Competency 1, and 1 credit on Competency 2, and 1 credit on Competency 3 (and those competencies are required), then the student's section earns 3 credits. J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   55  If \"Credits are defined on the section\" is selected: The CBE credit s are not related to the course  credits.  H   OURS  Decide whether to use hours for CBE elements. If so, do their hours roll up to determine the section hours?  If \"Use hours on CBE elements\" is deselected: CBE elements don't get hours.  If \"Hours roll up from CBE elements\" is selected: If the student earns 1 hour on Competency A, and 1 hour on Competency B, and 1 hour on Competency C (and those competencies are required), then the student's section earns 3 hours.  If \"Hours are defined on the section\" is selected: The CBE hours are not related to the course hours.  T   RANSCRIPT  You can have CBE elements show on transcripts in either or both of these ways or not at all:  •   Below each course  •   At the end of the transcript  D   EFINE THE   CBE   E   LEMENTS  The CBE elements that your school actually assigns to courses and sections are units and competencies. (Your school may give them different names.) Competencies are the smallest type CBE element you can assign to courses and sections.  If you wish, you can group competencies into units. Units are the broader type of CBE element. Units can include competencies.  For each competency or unit, you can assign the Maximum Category Level, the highest level you allow for that element. You can also assign a Learning Outcome.  Here's where the elements are defined:  •   CBE Type Definition window  o   The available types are predefined:     Unit     Competency  o   A unit can be the parent of one or more competencies. For example, Unit 1 could have Competency A and Competency B as children. Unit 2 could have Competencies C, D, and E.  o   In the future, there may be more types.  •   CBE Category Level Definition window J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   56  o   You define the categories.  o   Categories can be different types of skill sets, such as knowledge and technical skill.  o   You can create levels of proficiency for each category.  •   CBE Learning Outcomes Definition window  o   You define outcomes.  o   You can associate each outcome with a program, department, and college.  •   CBE Competency Definition window  o   This is where you combine all the elements to finish defining the competencies you want to measure.  o   Add competencies: the most specific skills you want to measure.  o   Assign their type (Unit or Competency); units can contain competencies in a parent-child relationship.  o   Set their maximum category-level default.  o   Assign their maximum duration.  o   Give them a description for transcripts.  o   Select an Advising Requirement Codes (ARC) for each.  o   Select Learning Outcomes for each.  With this setup complete, your CBEs are ready to assign to courses and sections.

J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   58  A   SSIGN   CBE   TO   C   OURSES AND   S   ECTIONS IN   J1   W   EB  You can assign CBE elements to a course (and, thus, the sections subsequently created from it) or to individual sections. After a course or section is designated as a CBE course, you can assign CBE elements to it.  The assigning process is similar whether you're working with a course or a section. In the Registration Administration hub, use the Manage Course Details page or Manage Section Details page.  W   HEN   Y   OU   '   RE   C   REATING A   C   OURSE OR   S   ECTION  When you're creating a course or a section, you can mark it as a CBE course or section. Then, in the Competencies tab of the Manage Course Details or Manage Section Details page, you can add the competencies.  FAQ  Why use CBE?  Schools can use CBE if they want to track competency in individual skills rather than merely grades in courses.  Why use Open Entry?  Schools can use Open Entry to allow students to take courses at their own pace. For example, a student could start a course at the beginning of a term, compete it at the midpoint of the term, and start a new course then.  Open Entry is very helpful to Competency Based Education, but schools can use either Open Entry or Competency Based Education with or without the other.  If I remove a CBE element (such as a unit) that has children (such as competencies), will the children be removed, too?  Yes. The parents and children will be removed from the course or section you're editing. They'll also be removed from the student's course history unless the record has the 'History' status.  Can I remove CBE elements from a student's course history?  Yes, if the record is not in 'History' status.  In fact, when you remove a CBE element from a course or section, it automatically gets removed from student course history records that are not in 'History' status.  When I create a section from a catalog course, does the section inherit CBE elements? J1 Web 2019.5 Registration Administration and Setup Guide   59  Yes. The section is designated as a CBE section, and it inherits any CBE elements the catalog course has at the moment of the section's creation. However, later changes to CBE elements in the catalog course won't affect the section. And if you make changes to the section, they don't affect the course.  Why does the documentation say \"CBE\" where my windows, field labels, messages, and drop-downs say something else?  \"CBE\" is the default display name that refers both to the Competency Based Education feature and to the elements of that feature. For example, we say a course is a CBE course, or it has CBE assigned to it. But your school can edit that display name on the J1 Desktop Registration Configuration window | Competency Based Education tab. The new display name appears in window names, field labels, and drop-downs.  In the documentation, we call them by their   default   names:  •   CBE Type Definition window  •   CBE Catalog Course filter  •   Manage CBE details button  But if your school changes the   display name from \"CBE\" to \"ABC\", they'll actually have these names:  •   ABC Type Definition window  •   ABC Catalog Course filter  •   Manage ABC details button  What if I don't know the name of the competency I want to add?  In J1 Desktop, open the CBE Competency Definition window. There you'll see all the competencies listed. Back on the Manage Course Details or Manage Section Details page in J1 Web, you can begin typing one of the competencies you saw listed.  Can a CBE course be repeated?  A CBE course can be repeated only if the repeat section and student course record have the same CBE elements as in the student's original section. (Other factors affect whether a course is repeatable. See the Repeat Course Process topic in J1 Desktop help.)  Which windows should I set up in which order for CBE?  In J1 Desktop, set up these windows.  1.   Registration Configuration  2.   CBE Type Definition  3.   CBE Category Level Definition  4.

A   CADEMIC   P   ERIODS  You can set up academic periods that are distinct from terms so you can use them for purposes (such as open enrollment) that aren't constrained by year/terms. A school year or calendar year might be a useful academic period.  Academic periods consist of a date range and some days-off items. Days-off items are days that you don't want counted within the period. They might be planned holidays or unplanned days off such as for weather emergencies.  You want to create an academic period that spans January through June. There are 4 holidays plus 5 days of spring break during that time, so first you create 9 days-off items. Then you create an academic period, and you add those 9 days-off items to it.  During that period, the school has to close unexpectedly for 2 days because of flooding. So you create 2 new days-off items, and you add them to the period.  A student has an open-enrollment course with 180 days to complete. Because the 4 holidays, 5 days of spring break, and 2 days of flooding, the student now has 11 extra days to complete the course.  Use this page to view, publish, edit, or delete academic periods. From here, you can also click the   Create academic period   button to open the Manage Academic Period window and create a new period there.
