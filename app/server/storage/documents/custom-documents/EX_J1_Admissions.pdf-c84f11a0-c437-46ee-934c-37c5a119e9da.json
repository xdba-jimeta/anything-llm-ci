The information you track will help you identify and recruit only the best candidates by providing effective communications management, organization of candidate information, and recruitment. EX Admissions Learning Guide   6  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Chapter 3.   C OUNSELORS AND   T ERRITORIES  This chapter will explain the process for identifying counselors for specific territories and assigning prospects accordingly.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Configure territories to align with counselors     Automatically assign candidates to a specific counselor  T ERRITORY   C ONFIGURATION  You can choose to assign a counselor to a candidate manually – in this case, you will not need to configure recruitment territories. However, if you would like to define specific territories for counselors, you will then be able to use several types of components to determine which counselor is assigned to each candidate.  The first step is to turn on the territory control feature in the Admissions Administration module.  1   On the   Module Configuration   window and select   Configuration   from the Function field  2   Locate the Territory Operations function and enter   Y   in the value EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  7  The next step is to configure the territory control feature in the Admissions Administration module.  3   On the   Module Configuration   window, select   Territory Control   from the Function field  You will find four options to configure  You can choose to use ranges for the alphabet when defining territories by entering a Y in this value  You can also choose to use ranges for zip codes when defining territories by entering a Y in this value  Identify a default counselor to be assigned to a candidate if no other match is found using other components  Choose either an Easy (only one component) or Complex (using more than one component) territory control EX Admissions Learning Guide   8  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  The next step is to identify the components you wish to use for territory control in the Admissions Administration module.  4   Go to the   Edit Territory Rank   window  o   If you   do not   want to use a component, enter a   0   in the Rank column  o   If you   do want to use a component, enter a number in sequential order depending on its rank  In the illustration displayed to the right, the State component will be used first and the Zip will be used next – therefore, territories will be assigned to counselors first by State and then by Zip. None of the other components will be used.  If you are using more than one component, you will want to start with the highest -  ranking component (lower number) and work up to the lower ranking component (higher number).  Since we have identified both the State and Zip for territory control, the next step is to identify the State for each counselor (since this is the highest-ranking component).  5   Go to the   Territory Configuration   window and select   STATE   from the Territory Component EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  9  6   Enter the two letter state name and, using the drop-down menu, select a counselor to be assigned to that state  You can choose either a counselor or the next territory component; however, you cannot choose both. The next territory component must be the next lower rank (highest number).  According to the selections made above, any candidates from the state of NY will be assigned to counselor AGN.  Any candidates from the state of VA will be assigned to the counselor who has been identified with the candidate's zip code.  7   On the   Territory Configuration   window and select   ZIP   from the Territory Component  8   Enter a zip code and, using the drop-down menu, select a counselor to be assigned to the zip  In the illustration above, candidates with a zip code of 22801 will be assigned to counselor DGM, candidates with a zip code of 22807 will be assigned to counselor AGN, and candidates with a zip code of 22802 will be assigned to counselor ELG. Since 10 different components exist, you will want to consider your decision regarding the assignment of counselors to candidates – for example:  Alpha   Assign candidates to counselors according to the first letter of their last name  Division or Program   Assign candidates to counselors depending on program of interest  State, Zip, or County   Assign candidates to counselors according to geographical location  Candidacy Type   Assign candidates to counselors by freshman, transfer, or graduate student status  You can also use a combination of components. EX Admissions Learning Guide   10  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  When all components have been identified, you may find some candidates have not yet been associated with a counselor. In this case, the default counselor that was defined on the Territory Configuration will be assigned to any candidate with a state, zip, program, etc. that has not been identified with a counselor.  If a default counselor was not defined on the Territory Configuration, the candidate will not be assigned to a counselor. EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  11  Chapter 4.   T RACKING   C ANDIDATES  This chapter will provide details for identifying, recruiting, and maintaining information on the best candidates for your institution.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Enter information about candidates     Understand how the candidate information is tracked within the EX system     Identify requirements, fees, and scholarships for each candidate  E NTERING   D ATA  Details about each applicant and future matriculating student at your school can be entered into your system through the Admissions module.  If you have a large quantity of names to be entered into the system (such as a stack of cards) with minimal information, you can use the   Quick Candidate Entry   or the   Quick Name Entry   for data entry purposes and then add more details at a later time.  As you can see, there are no additional tabs on this window and you can quickly enter basic information such as name, address, and the type of source that introduced the person to your institution. EX Admissions Learning Guide   12  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Duplicate Name Search  When you enter a new name into the system you should always check to make sure the name does not already exist in EX. In the example below, you are entering a new person (Billy A. Steadman) into the  Quick Candidate Entry   window.  When you click save, the system automatically does a check on the name to ensure it does not already exist in the system. If a possible match is detected, it will appear on the Duplicate Name Search window so that you can determine if the name you are entering is new or existing.  In this instance, you are entering a Billy A. Steadman Jr. and a Billy Alger Steadman Jr. is already in your system. If you think a name on the list could be a match, click one of the buttons on the bottom to view more details, addresses, and name history. EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  13  After looking over the data details, you can see that the addresses and birthdates match. If you conclude that the name you entered is a duplicate and you have found the correct match, click the   Select Match  button to open the existing entity’s details. However, if none of the names on the   Duplicate Name Search   window are an exact match for the new name, click the   No Match - New ID   button to continue creating a new ID number for the new name.  The Duplicate Name Search process should be run every time a new name is entered into the EX system. It can be difficult to combine or remove duplicate names once they are in use. EX Admissions Learning Guide   14  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  M AINTAIN   C ANDIDACY  On the other hand, if you have more details about a person, you can enter data on the   Maintain Candidacy   window.  As you can see, there are several tabs where you can enter information related to the candidate such as name, address, test scores, etc. EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  15  Candidate Tab     Assign a counselor to the candidate     Enter the expected year of graduation     Identify the candidate's housing preference     Select the high school or organization last attended (this information must be previously entered in the Org Master)     Identify sources that have been associated with this candidate  o   A source can be an online application, an open house, a college fair, etc. and you can define these Sources and Source Types in the Admission Administration module  If a counselor is marked as inactive on the Counselor Responsible Definition window, that counselor will not be available from the Counselor Responsible drop-down list on the Maintain Candidacy Candidate tab.  Transcript Information  You can enter and track details on a candidate's history with each organization such as GPA, class rank, graduation date, rank percentile, etc. both from a transcript or self-reported by the candidate.  1   Right-click and choose the   Organizations for Candidate   option  2   Choose an organization from the   Org Tracking   tab EX Admissions Learning Guide   16  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  3   Click on the   Additional Info   tab  4   Enter the appropriate organization or self-reported academic information for the candidate.  When the   Calculate   checkbox is selected, the academic information that is entered on the   Additional Info tab   above will be compared with the minimum values that may have been defined for a requirement. This feature is especially useful if you have identified a minimum GPA or rank in order for a requirement to be met.  You can configure the candidate graduation year in the Admission Administration module and choose from three options.  5   Go to the   Module Configuration   window  6   Locate   CANGRADYEAR EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  17  7   Choose the L, H, or N value depending on the results you would like to see  o   Graduation Year   on the   Candidate tab   will be updated with the following:  L   Graduation Year that has been identified for the   Last Organization ( Additional  Info tab   of   Organization Tracking for Student )  H   Graduation Year that has been identified for the   Last High School ( Additional Info  tab   of   Organization Tracking for Student ) EX Admissions Learning Guide   18  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  The Last High School checkbox will only be available if the name has been assigned an organization type of HS (High School) in the Organization Master  N   No automatic update from the Organization Tracking for Student window   –   manually  enter the graduation year  Using the example provided, the   L   configuration has been selected – therefore, the   Graduation Year   on the   Candidate tab   will display the   Graduation Year   that has been identified for the Last Organization as illustrated below:  When you identify a High School on the   Candidate tab   without a Last Organization Attended, the High School ID number will be automatically copied into the Last Organization Attended field.  When Org Tracking does not exist for a candidate, a record will be created using the Last High School or the Last Organization Attended depending on where the ID was entered.  The opposite is also true – that is, if you change the Last High School on Org Tracking or Org Master, the ID numbers on the   Candidate   tab will be updated. EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  19  Ca ndidacy Tab     Select the candidate's program of study for each candidacy     Identify the stage and stage date  o   The stages are defined in the Admissions Administration module     Use the   Stop Transfer to RE   checkbox if you DO NOT want to have this information uploaded into the Registration module when the candidate becomes a matriculating student  o   This checkbox is related to the Admissions to Registration Transfer Process – if this checkbox is selected or if the   Set Stop Transfer to Yes   option is selected on the   Transfer Process tab   of the   Admissions to Registration Transfer   window, the student will not be entered into Registration     View the sub-tabs which allow you to keep track of requirements, fees, scholarships, and attached files  While several candidacies can be defined, only one can (and must) be identified as current.  You must identify a year, program, and stage for each candidacy. EX Admissions Learning Guide   20  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Notice that there are several sub-tabs displayed on the right side of this window – this allows you to maintain various components related to this particular candidacy. For example, click on the  Requirements sub-tab .  When a requirement has been received or requested, click on the   Recv'd Req   checkbox – the system will automatically select the   Completion Status ,   Min met   and   Print   checkboxes. The   Recv'd Req   checkbox will also be updated for each requirement as shown below:  GPA/RANK/UNIT   When the defined minimum has been met  TEST   When the test has been received  TSTEL   When the defined element minimum has been met  You can prevent a student from being processed any further by manually selecting   Held   for one or more requirements from the   Hold/Rel   drop-down menu. There actually is a   Held   stage that you can configure when identifying your stages. In this case, anything that is identified as being eligible for the   Held   stage will automatically place a candidate in that stage and activate the   Held   status. EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  21  Defining Requirements  Before you can assign tests to a candidate, you will need to define the tests on the   Requirement Definition   window in the Admissions Administration module.  There are six general categories of requirement types which are pre-defined – you cannot change, add, or delete these categories since they are directly linked to processes within the Admissions module.  Each category will determine how the requirement applies to the candidate and whether the specified requirement has been met. EX Admissions Learning Guide   22  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  The minimum values that are assigned to a particular requirement will be considered a standard minimum for all candidates unless customized for specific programs. When you use the   Program Control   feature, which automatically moves candidates through candidacy stages, you   must   define requirements. When you use the   Automatic Acceptance   feature, you must also define requirements as well as minimums.  Jenzabar recommends that you always define requirements in order to use consistent guidelines and make proper acceptance decisions.  Once your requirements have been defined, you can create a Requirement List by grouping individual requirements and easily assign the entire group to one or more candidates.  1   Go to the   Requirement List Definition   window  2   Right-click and select the   Add a Row   option  3   Enter both a code and a description for the requirement list  4   Select one or more requirements from the Available Requirements section of the window and click on the   Add   button to move them to the Selected Requirements section  For example, in the illustration on the right, you'll notice that four individual requirements have been identified for the  CORE   requirement list.  This method is an excellent way to quickly assign a group of requirements to a candidate. EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  23  Assigning Requirements  1   On the Maintain Candidacy window, click on the   Candidacy   tab  2   Select the   Requirements   sub - tab  3   Click on the drop-down arrow and choose a   Requirement Code  4   To view the available requirement lists, right-click on a row and choose the   Select Requirements   option  5   Choose a requirement list and click on the   Add to Requirements   button  You can assign more than one requirement list to a candidate.  After the requirements have been assigned to a candidate, you can also modify them for individual candidates and candidacies. For example, you might assign an essay requirement to a candidacy and then modify the description to \"High School English Essay.” Another essay requirement can also be assigned to the same candidacy and you can modify the description to \"Personal Ambition Essay.”  Use the   Fees sub-tab   to keep track of application and/or enrollment fees that may have been collected from the candidate.  The information on this tab is not related to any other table in the database. EX Admissions Learning Guide   24  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You may use the   Admissions Release   checkbox to indicate that this candidate information can be sent to other offices such as Registration or Business Office.  Use the   History sub-tab   to view the various stages that the candidate has been assigned along with the date of each stage.  Use the   Scholarships sub-tab   to identify one or more scholarships that may have been awarded to the candidate. EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  25  Use the   Attachments sub-tab   to add and view essays that are submitted by candidate or any other text that may be relevant to the candidacy. You will need to define your attachments in the Admissions Administration module:  1   Go to the   Attachment Type Definition   window  2   Enter a code and description for your attachments and select the AD_CANDCY use code to identify the attachment for the Admissions module  After your attachments have been defined, you will be able to select one of these types from the  Candidacy tab .  An attachment can be saved in either a TXT format (added directly on the   Attachments sub-tab ) or HTML format (submitted through JICS using a form). EX Admissions Learning Guide   26  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  3   To add an attachment, right-click and select the   Add Row   option  o   The current date will automatically appear in the Submission Date field and you can change it if necessary  o   Since the attachment is created directly on the   Attachment sub-tab , the Submission Type will automatically be identified as   Manual  4   Select a description from the drop-down menu  5   Save   the row  6   Now right-click on the row that was just created and select the   Create Attachment  option  7   Enter the text and   Save  The document icon will be displayed indicating that text has been added to the attachment – if the document icon does not appear, your row may have been created, but the actual text has not yet been added.  Test Scores     Choose a test from the drop-down menu  o   You will be able to enter the test date and indicate if the information was reported by the candidate or requested     To edit any of the scores, right- click on a row and choose the  Edit Test Scores   option EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  27  The highest test scores and requirements calculation will be displayed on the Highest tab. Self-reported tests will not be included in these calculations nor will they be used for requirements.  After a conversion has occurred, you will want to recalculate the highest test scores for candidates in the Admission Administration module.  Go to the   Recalculate Highest Test Scores   window  You can recalculate one individual ID number or use a query to select a specific group.  By selecting the   Run Stage Change Process   checkbox, the system will also check each ID number processed to determine if a candidate's stage changed as a result of the recalculation and, if so, the stage will be changed accordingly. EX Admissions Learning Guide   28  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Attributes  You can identify any type of characteristic such as a sport, interest, award, or association with a group or organization by using the Attribute feature. These attributes can then be assigned to a candidate.  You can target specific candidates for recruitment purposes. Attribute types are defined on the   Maintain Table Values   window in the Common module.  If you use attribute types, you will then need to grant permissions to each group on the Attribute User Access window, also in the Common module. EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  29  Select a group and then move one or more attribute types from the Available Attribute Type section to the Selected Attribute Type section. When an individual selects a group when logging into the EX system, only the attribute types to which access has been granted will be available. This is the main reason for you to seriously consider whether or not you want to use attribute types.  You can also ask your database administrator to add any columns to the Attribute_Trans_UDF table that will be displayed on the user-defined form. You can access this form by clicking on the   User   button as illustrated below.  Now you can customize the attributes feature to fit within the requirements of your school! EX Admissions Learning Guide   30  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Relationship  Use this tab to identify a candidate's relationship to existing names within the EX system.  A relationship is used to reference a connection or association of one person, group, or organization to another person, group, or organization. More than one relationship can exist for any ID number.  Relationships in the Admissions module can be used to identify that an alumnus is the parent of a candidate.  Organizations  You can identify any type of organization that is associated with the candidate.  The information displayed here is the same information that is displayed on the Organization Tracking for Student window.  If you need to enter an organization for a candidate that does not already exist ...  1   Click on the   Candidate   tab  2   Right-click and select the   Organizations for Candidates   option  3   Right-click and select the   Org Master   option EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  31  4   When the   Maintain Organization Master   window appears, click the   Add Name   button  o   The   Name Entity   window will be displayed  Notice that the Name Option will automatically default to B (Business/Organization) due to the steps you performed to get to this window. EX Admissions Learning Guide   32  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  5   Enter the organization name in the   Business Name   column and click the   Save   button  o   The next sequential ID number will be assigned to this organization  6   Enter other appropriate information  7   When you return to the   Maintain Organization Master   window, right-click and select the   Add Row   option  8   Enter the new organization ID number and press the Tab key  o   The name, code, type, and school type will be populated with the information that was just entered in the   Name Entity   window EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  33  Chapter 5.   M OVING   T HROUGH   S TAGES  This chapter will explain the process of moving a candidate from the application stage to the accepted stage within the Admissions module.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand the implication of using stages in your configuration  D EFINING   S TAGES  Since a candidate can exist in any phase between initial inquiry and acceptance or rejection into an institution, the Admissions module allows you to define stages that will identify the position of the candidate within the admissions process.  You can automatically move candidates into a certain stage when a particular set of requirements have been met. For example:     Assign a list of requirements that a candidate must meet and, once met, the candidate will automatically move to another stage     Automatically attach an action list to a specific stage to follow up on the candidacy     Depending on the information that exists in a candidacy, candidates can move through stages     Automatically accept or reject a candidate based on the criteria you have defined for stages  A new record is created for each stage in which a candidate enters – therefore, you can always track the date when a candidate left one stage and entered another.  You can create as many stages as necessary to fit your institutional requirements – the Admissions module includes one default stage of APPLCN (Application). Each stage must belong to one of the seven pre-defined stage levels. EX Admissions Learning Guide   34  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Your stages can be created on the   Stage Definition   window in the Admissions Administration module.  1   Go to the   Stage Definition  window  Notice the   Order   column – this is used to identify the sequential order of stages for a candidate.  2   Right-click and select the  Add Row   option  3   Select one of the seven pre-defined stage levels and then proceed to define a number and description for your stage  When defining your stages, you can choose many options such as:     Attaching an action list to a stage     Moving a candidate to another stage if requirements are released or not released     Moving a candidate to another stage if requirements are met or not met     Allowing a candidate to move either forwards or backwards in stages     Allowing a candidate to register at a particular stage  4   After a stage has been defined, you can edit the characteristics by right-clicking on the respective row on the   Stage Definition   window and selecting the   Edit Stage Configuration   option EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  35  Depending on the stage level, the available characteristics will vary – the screen capture below shows a stage using the PSTAPP stage level.  For all stages except those that belong to the   Defer To   or   Defer From   level, you can identify requirements for validation purposes, check acceptance levels, add action lists, and move candidates to another stage if requirements are met.  Defer To/Defer From  You may have a situation where a candidate has been accepted into your school and, for some reason, will not be attending when originally anticipated- in this case, you can use the   Defer To   stage.  When a candidate is moved into the   Defer  To   stage, you may receive a message as shown to the right.  A   Defer From   candidacy will automatically be created. Requirements and any other data that was in the original stage will be copied into the new   Defer From   stage which is editable.  The Defer To candidacy record will be identified as 'deferred' and will be available in  READ ONLY mode. No actions can be performed on a candidacy in the Defer To stage.

O B JECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Successfully transfer candidate data from the Admissions module into the Registration module  A DMISSIONS   V ALIDATION  When you are using both the Jenzabar EX Admissions and Registration modules, you will be able to utilize the   Admissions Validation   feature. You will need to perform the following two steps.  In Admissions:  1   Select the   Allow Registration   checkbox when configurating a stage EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  37  In Registration:  2   Select one of the following options in the Registration Administration module ( Registration Configuration )  o   None  o   Warning – All  o   Warning – Candidates Only  o   Stop – All  o   Stop – Candidates Only  None   No validation occurs on the Admissions module and you can register any student in Registration  Warning   –   All   If you attempt to register a student who either does not exist in Admissions or belongs to a stage that does not allow registration, a warning message will appear – however, you will be able to ignore the warning and register the student  Wa rning   –  Candidates Only  If you attempt to register a student who does exist in Admissions and belongs to a  stage that does not allow registration, a warning message will appear – however, you will be able to ignore the warning and register the student  St op   –   All   If you attempt to register a student who either does not exist in Admissions or belongs to a stage that does not allow registration, you will not be able to register the student  Stop   –  Candidates Only  If you attempt to register a student who do es exist in Admissions and belongs to a  stage that does not allow registration, you will not be able to register the student EX Admissions Learning Guide   38  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  I DENTIFYING   C ANDIDATES AND   C RITERIA  Before beginning this process, you may want to create a Transfer user with function security granted for the   Admissions to Registration Transfer   window. In this way, any person processing this transfer can log in as Transfer user and automatically be granted the appropriate permissions.  The process of   pushing   data from Admissions into Registration or   pulling   data into Registration from Admissions consists of a multitude of options. These options will allow you to identify the exact data that will become part of the student's degree history record.  We recommend that you create smaller sub-sets of groups on which to perform the transfer process to provide you with more control over choosing the correct options.  1   Go to the   Admissions to Registration Transfer   window  2   On the   Select Candidates   tab, select an existing Transfer Profile or create a new one by entering a name and clicking the   Save As   button  o   The profile will be saved as a user preference  3   Choose one of the elements (year and term, stage, division, program, etc.) on which the query will be performed  4   Click the   Retrieve Candidates   button EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  39  5   The   Selected Candidates   radio button will be selected in the Query Options section and a list of all candidates who meet the criteria will be displayed  6   If you would like to further define the criteria, click on the   Change   button  7   In this example, you can select one or more rows and click on the   Remove   button or use the drag and drop feature to move candidates from the Selected section to the Available section  o   Your change options will vary depending on the criteria chosen – therefore, if you chose Stages as your element, this window will allow you to remove stages rather than candidates EX Admissions Learning Guide   40  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  8   Click   OK  9   Once you are satisfied with the candidates that have been selected for the transfer, click on the   Transfer Process   tab  Take sufficient time to understand each of the checkboxes that are available on this window as they will determine the information that is transferred into Registration and the tables that will be updated.  If a match is found in Degree History for the current candidacy's major program, a new record will be   Inserted   or an existing record will be   Updated   in the Degree History table, depending on the checkboxes that have been selected. You can select both options.  When a checkbox is selected, the Student Master will be updated with the information from Admissions.  If you are also using EX Student Life, there is no need for you to identify the   Resident Commuter Status   here (on the Student Master).  If you are not using EX Student Life, you can use this checkbox to bring over the   Resident Commuter Status   into Registration. EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  41  Information will be inserted in the TW Group Membership table if either checkbox is selected.  Only applicable if you are licensed for the EX Web module.  Selecting this checkbox will prevent the student from being transferred into Registration and will automatically check the   Stop Transfer to RE   checkbox on the   Candidacy   tab.  Select the   Entry Date checkbox and enter a date to update the Student Division Master.  If   Expected Grad Year/Term   is selected, you will need to enter the year and term here. If at least one row exists in the Student Division Master but not for this particular division, select the checkbox to insert a   New Row for New Division .  Select the   Entry Date checkbox and enter a date to update the Degree History.  Select   Degree   and   Major/Certification/Minor   to update the Degree History table.     You will need to map these three programs on the Program Definition window since Admissions does not use the same majors, certifications, and minors that have been defined in Registration.  If   Expected Grad Year/Term   is selected, you will need to enter the year and term here.  Only available if you are licensed for EX Advising, you can use the   Adv Institutional Req  checkbox to update the Advising Tree Year Code in the Degree History table and create aims for the selected Major or Certification.  The ID number, Division, Degree (only if not completed) and Degree Earned at *LOCAL will be updated accordingly if the appropriate radio button is selected.  A new row is added to the Degree History regardless of the rows that currently exist when  Always Add Degree   is selected.  An existing Degree History   IS   updated when   Update Existing, Add New Degree   radio button is selected and the existing degree   IS NOT   updated when   Ignore Existing, Add New Degree  radio button is selected. If either case, when no match is found, a new row is inserted.  No update occurs when   Skip if Local Degrees Exist   radio button is selected. If it does not exist, a new row is inserted in the Degree History table.  When   Make New/Updated Row Current   checkbox is selected (and in addition to the other options in this group), any row updated or inserted is set as the Current Degree for the candidate ID. If this checkbox is not selected, the Current Degree does not change for the candidate ID.  When the   Resident Commuter Status   checkbox is selected, you must also identify a session.  If you are also using EX Student Life, your office will want to maintain the   Resident Commuter Status   and   Session   information directly in the Student Life database rather than in Registration; therefore, there is no need to identify this information here. EX Admissions Learning Guide   42  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  You may choose a cluster on which the Rules Based Update will be processed and view the status in the Application Log File. Rules Based Update is defined in Registration – therefore, you will need to create the cluster in Registration before you can select it in Admissions.  10   When you are certain that all of the appropriate information has been selected, click the   Transfer Data   button EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  43  Chapter 7.

For example, if an address change was submitted via the My Info portlet in JICS, you can determine the offices and specific individuals in each office that need to be informed of this change in a priority order.  If the person submitting the change is both a student and a constituent, you can decide which office should take priority for update purposes.  This is especially useful when a person belongs to more than one role.  6   After assigning a priority order for each role, click   Save EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  45  P ROCESSING   I NTERNET   S UBMISSIONS  After the proper configurations have been performed in the Common module, you will be able to review and process submissions in the Admissions module.  1   Go to the   Process Internet Submissions   window  o   Highlight a row and click on the submission type to view the actual application that was submitted by the candidate as illustrated below:  o   Highlight a row and click on the name to send an email to the person who submitted the application EX Admissions Learning Guide   46  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  2   Highlight a row and click the   Process   button  o   You can make changes to the data on this window  3   Click the   Save All   button  o   If any required data elements are missing, you will receive a message which allows you to correct the data issue  o   For example, the submission may have required a payment that was not yet received – you can continue with the processing or cancel  4   When you click the   Save All   button, or if you close the window without saving, the following message will be displayed:  5   Click   Yes   or   No   depending on whether you want the submission data to be available for processing at another time EX Admissions Learning Guide  J e   nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  47  Chapter 8.   U PLOADING   D AT A  This chapter will explain the process for adding data to your EX database from an outside source and ensure no duplicate names are added.  O BJECTIVES     Use the import utility     Check for duplicate names  U SING THE   I MPORT   U TILITY  You can also use the Import Utility tool to bring data into your system from an outside source and compare to verify that the information does not already exist.  The data is imported into staging tables that are identified with the IU preface. You can then work within these staging tables to search for duplicates and verify the information. When all of your validations have been completed, you can proceed with the actual process of importing the data into your production database from the staging tables.  1   Go to the   Admissions Import Utility   window  2   Click the   Upload Criteria   tab  The default profile will display a list of tables and columns that are available for import – the IU letters indicate that this is a staging table for the Import Utility. Three columns can identify whether the column is used, required, or searched for duplicates. Once you click on the   Used   column, the   Required   and   Dup Search   columns will become available.  You can also make changes to the default and save it as a new profile. EX Admissions Learning Guide   48  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  3   Select   Check Database   from the Database menu  4   Click   Yes   to check the staging database for required columns  5   If no errors occur, you may click   OK   on the message that indicates so  o   If errors do occur, check the   Error Log tab   for a list of the results  6   Click   Yes   to check the staging database for any possible matches in the EX production database  S EARCHING FOR   D UPLICATE   I NFORMATION  During this process, several steps are performed to search for duplicate information by comparing the outside data source with the system database:     The first step will verify data on the   Name tab   since this is the primary source of relational data – the temporary ID number that is created by the Import Utility will be compared with the existing ID number in Admissions     The second step will verify data on the   Biography tab  o   For example, if a match is found between one of the columns, a Y will appear in the appropriate column on the Duplicates tab.     The third step will verify data on the   Address ,   Candidate ,   Candidacy ,   Test Scores , and   Test Score Detail tabs  The   Duplicates tab   will display all information that has found to be a match between the outside data source and the production database.  The   Multiple Matches tab   displays the duplicate search columns as well as the corresponding data that was found for each. When you find a matching row, select the   Match   checkbox and click   OK   – the remaining rows will be deleted. Continue this process until there are no more rows in the   Remaining to Verify   section.  When you have identified all of the correct information to be imported into your production database, select   Upload Data   from the Upload menu to complete the import process.",
