Presented by  Mary Anne Lee, Madonna University  May 28 to 31, 2014 – Washington, DC  208 Educating Advisors on Courses, ARC’s, Aims, Trees and Their Relationship to Each Other © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Why would we want to educate our advisors in the Office of Academic Advising on Courses, Arc’s, Aims and Trees and how they are related?     New advisors - new to the University and new to advising students -  now using the Graduation Audit report, Advising Worksheet and ASR     We also have faculty who have taken on the role of advising students  or they just want a refresher on using Jenzabar     The advisors felt they needed to understand the relationships  between courses, ARC’s and trees and how they appear on the  reports  Educating Advisors © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  The Plan:  Find a simple explanation on the relationship between courses, ARCs, and trees.   Nothing technical such as groups or priorities.  The Solution :  1.   Create a short presentation explaining how all items are connected  2.   The answer as to why a course shows in Free Electives when it should  be the major, minor, general education or university core requirement. © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     Aims, Arcs, Trees and Plans of Study     Advisors want to know what they mean and how they make the report work. How are they connected?     First is an explanation of the summary section of the Graduation Audit report, then Plan of Study, a course, ARC and finally Trees.  Where do I start? © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Why the summary section of the Graduation Audit Report?   Because it contains a student’s Aims, bulletin year, hours needed, hours earned, hours in progress, and GPA, etc.  AIMS are the individual items that are assigned to each student.  All of the AIMS together compose the student’s complete plan of study. © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.

The advisors want to know what makes this course appear on the Graduation Audit report. What guides it to the correct place on the audit?  Course and ARCs  ARC – Advising Requirement Code –   attached  to the course. It is used to pull the course into the  Tree.  Course –   a unit that covers one  Individual subject. © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  How are they all connected?     Group of Courses has been determined     Courses are assigned ARCs (Advising Requirement Code)     ARCs are used to build Institutional Tree     Institutional Tree = Plan of Study © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     Why is the course in the wrong place?  could be wrong ARC, programming issue     Why is the course in Free Electives, when it should be in the major?  could be the same answer as above or even a grade issue     Why does it show in two or three places?  because it is in each plan of study or even in one plan of study several different times  Advisor questions: © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Expectations  Part of the training I give everyone includes the statement:  “If you have questions about the location of a course or  anything on the audit report or worksheet, call me.”  Because this means I could have a problem with the tree  and it needs to be corrected. © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.
