Most Jenzabar users have membership in more than one Application Group.   These Application Groups provide  various levels of access to the Jenzabar Modules and Functions. If you are   u able to access certain modules and  functions from your current login, it is likely that you need to switch to a different Application Group .  This document explains how to change your Application Group during the login process.   This document also  explains how to switch your database connection. There is a Production Database, “J1 Desktop”, and a  Play/Tra ining Database, “Play Database”.  PRECONDITIONS  The user must have a Jenzabar account. The user must know the user name and password for their account.  THE LOGIN SCREEN  In the lower right - hand corner of your Jenzabar screen is a Database connection control.   It tells you the name of  the database you are connected to. In the following illustration, the database is “TmsEPrd” which is the  production database. It has an alias on the login   screen. The alias for the connection is, “J1 Desktop”.  When you hover over the Database connection control, you will see your current login information.   It includes  your User ID, Current Group ID, the SQL Server name, and your SPID (unique process ID in SQL S erver). It also  tells you that you can Double - Click to logon to a different database.   See Figure 0.  Figure   0   –   The current connection status.  Double - Click on the database connection control.   The   Jenzabar Login screen   will be displayed.   See Figure 1. Figure 1   –   The Jenzabar EX Login Screen  The “Use Default Application Group” check box   on the Login Screen   allows users who belong to multiple  application groups to quickly log in without the requirement of selecting an application group to which they  belong. If a user consistently logs in with a particular application group and rarely connects to the EX appli cation  using one of the other groups to which they belong, they should set their default application group to be the  one most frequently needed.  CHANGING TO A DIFFERENT DATABASE  Th e login   screen also allows you to select   a different database to log into. If you wish to change from the  Production database, “J1 Desktop”, to the Play database, “Play Database”, just select the “Pl ay Database” from  the drop - down menu and click the “OK” button. You will now be logged into the Play database. To go back to  the production database ,   follow this same procedure, but select   the “J1 Desktop” database instead.  CHANGING THE DEFAULT APPLICATION GROUP SETTING IN USER PREFERENCES  The user's default application group setting is stored in User Preferences (Tools | User Preferences). The user  can alter this setting at any time; however, the change of default application group will only take effect the next  time the user starts an EX m odule. See Figure 2 and 3. Figure 2   –   The Tools | User Preferences menu item.  Figure 3   –   The “Default Application Group” selection list on the User Preferences screen.  Select your preferred “Default Application Group” from the drop - down list and click the Save button in the  upper left hand corner of the Jenzabar screen. See Figure 4.  Figure 4   –   The “Save” button.  LOGGING IN USING A DIFFERENT APPLICATION GROUP  When logging into an EX module, if the user wishes to connect using a different application group, clear the Use  Default Application Group check box and click the OK button.   Once the user clicks OK, if they are a member of  more than one application group, then a Group list box column appears for them to select the group in which  they wish to log in.   See Figures 5 and 6. Figure 5   –   Uncheck the “Use Default Application Group” checkbox.  Figure 6   –   Select the desired Application Group from the drop - down list.  You will be logged in with the permission set of the Application Group which you selected from the drop - down  list.  The user can also change the group in which they are logged in via the   “ D atabase   Connection ”   butto n   (See figure  7)   in the Workspace status bar.   Double - c licking the database name opens   the login screen. F ollow the steps as  described above   to log into a different Application Group . Figure 7   –   Double - click on the “Database Connection” button to change your current login.  END OF WORK   INSTRUCTIONS",
