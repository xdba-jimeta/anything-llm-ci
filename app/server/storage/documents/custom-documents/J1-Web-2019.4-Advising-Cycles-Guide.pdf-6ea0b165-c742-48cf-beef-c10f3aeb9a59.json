J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Cycles Guide   6  P   ROCESS   O   VERVIEW  Advising cycles define advising milestones such as setting up when an advisor is available to meet with their advisees and the period of time when those meetings will end for a selected catalog year. This process keeps advisors and students engaged and Advising Module Managers aware of progress.  Advising cycles are associated with year/terms or sub-terms and student tel web registration groups to determine when advisors and appropriate advisees meet within the registration time frame (advising cycles provide great flexibility and can take place before or during your registration period).  Academic Advising Module Managers set the advising cycles up and monitor advisors and their advising student interactions as they step through the process. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Cycles Guide   7  J1   D   ESKTOP   S   ETUP FOR   A   DVISING   C   YCLES  The following J1 Desktop configurations need to be in place to ensure advising cycles can be set up correctly in J1 Web.  •   Year/terms or sub-terms should be set up in J1 Desktop and designated as ready for advising cycle ( Year Term Subterm   window,   Year Term   tab &   Year/term Control for Web Registration Groups  or   Subterm Control for Web Registration Groups   tabs). Advising cycle start and end dates typically coincide with those set up for the year/term or sub-term. The system looks at the Add End Date for each web group and J1 Web makes those that are before the add end date, are not attached to another cycle, and are designated as 'ready for advising cycle.' When the appropriate year/term or sub-terms are available, they can be associated with an advising cycle on the Advising Administration hub,   Create Advising Cycles ,   Advising Cycles Basics   page.  •   Web groups should be associated with the appropriate year/terms or sub-terms in J1 Desktop ( Year Term Subterm   window). Advisees associated with the web group are automatically assigned to the associated advising cycle.  Academic Advising Module Managers can select the student web groups to be associated with the advising cycle on the Advising Administration hub,   Create Advising Cycles ,   Select Student Web Groups   page.  •   Advisees should be associated with a web group (J1 Desktop   Student Information   and/or J1 Desktop   Maintain Web Reg Group Code   window). Advisees are then included with the student web groups associated with the advising cycle. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Cycles Guide   8  A   DVISING   A   DMINISTRATION  C   REATE   A   DVISING   C   YCLES  The four-step wizard walks you through creating a new advising cycle. You can share a draft or proposed version of the advising cycle with advisors/stakeholders for review before publishing and making it available to advisors. The following provide an overview of each step in the wizard.  S   ET   U   P   A   DVISING   C   YCLE   B   ASICS  During this step, you can enter basic information about the advising cycle including the name, the start and end dates, and years/terms or sub-terms to be associated with the advising cycle. The years/terms/sub-terms available to be selected are determined by what years/terms or sub-terms are designated as   Ready for Advising Cycle   on the J1 Desktop   Year Term Subterm   window, Year/Term Control for Web Registration Groups or Subterm Control for Web Registration Groups tabs.  Review your school's registration periods before setting up your advising cycles to guide what name and dates you use. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Cycles Guide   9  S   ELECT   S   TUDENT   W   EB   G   ROUPS  During this step, you can select what student web groups will be associated with the new advising cycle. These web groups determine which students will be associated with the advising cycles (J1 Desktop  Student Information   and/or J1 Desktop   Maintain Web Reg Group Code   window).  The web groups a vailable to be selected are determined by which ones are associated with a  specific year/term or sub-term on the   Year Term Subterm   window, Year/Term Control for Web Registration Groups or Subterm Control for Web Registration Groups tabs. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Cycles Guide   10  S   ELECT   M   ILESTONES  During this step, you can select standard milestones and create/enable custom milestones to be associated with the advising cycle. Custom milestones could be registration begin/end dates, course add/drop dates, or a reoccurring meeting you have with your advisors at the end of an advising cycle to discuss advising success. You can also determine if you want automated messages and tasks to be created for the milestones to help to keep advisors on target for meeting advising cycle goals.  Custom milestones set up for one advising cycle can be used with other advising cycles. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Cycles Guide   11  S   ET   U   P THE   A   DVISING   C   YCLE   C   ALENDAR  During this step, you can set up when milestones will be due using the calendar. Using the calendar helps show how the milestones will be laid out.

This gives you an opportunity to get feedback on the cycle timeline and milestones, and make any needed updates before publishing and making available to advisors. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Cycles Guide   13  P   UBLISH TO   A   DVISORS  During this step, you can publish the advising cycle and select the users you want to notify. For example, you may want to notify your advisors to allow them to start planning their advising appointments. You do not have to notify advisors in order to publish the cycle.  Once you start creating the advising cycle, it is considered draft and can be updated until it is published. This allows you to complete the wizard if you need to return and finish setting it up at a later time, or need to make updates based on feedback from colleagues before publishing it and making it available to advisors.

J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Cycles Guide   19  FAQ  What are advising cycles?  Advising cycles define a time period when advisors assist students with course planning and registration, and direct them to college resources such as Learning Centers or Career Services for a selected year/term/subterm.  What are advising cycle milestones?  Advising cycle milestones are key events that occur during an advising cycle that help keep advisors on track to meet with all their advisees during an advising time period set up by your school. Automated tasks and messages can be associated to milestones as reminders of pending deadlines. There are three types of milestones:  •   Core Milestones   such as when the cycle begins and ends are required. Tasks and/or messages are automatically associated with these milestones.  •   Advisee Meetings   milestones determine when advisors are responsible for setting up their availability and meeting with advisees, and when advisees will be able to select available advising appointments. Advisors will automatically receive tasks and/or messages for these milestones.  •   Created by you   milestones are custom milestones such as meeting with an advisee's peer mentor or an advising cycle retrospective. You can create as many milestones as you want and they can be used in other advising cycles you can choose to use them or not.  Why are only certain years/terms/sub-terms available?  There are two reasons a year/term or sub-term might not be available:  •   The years/term/sub-terms may not have been designated as ready by your registrar's office in J1 Desktop.  •   The year/term/sub-terms may not fall within time frame you selected for the cycle are available.  •   The year/term/sub-term might already be associated with another advising cycle. Year/terms/sub-terms can only be associated with one advising cycle.  Why are only certain tel web groups available?  The web groups available to be selected are determined by which ones are associated with a specific year/term or sub-term on the J1 Desktop   Year Term Subterm   window, Year/Term Control for Web Registration Groups or Subterm Control for Web Registration Groups tabs.
