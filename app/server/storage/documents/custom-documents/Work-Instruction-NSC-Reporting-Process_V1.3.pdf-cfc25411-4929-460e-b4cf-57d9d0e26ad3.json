The NSC reporting tools within  the Jenzabar EX product are the   preferred tools for accomplishing this task.  Preconditions  -   The review and correction of data quality issues on student records must be complete and at  100% conformity prior to running the NSC reporting process. See work instructions pertaining  to Data Qul aity and Consistency report useage.   [TO DO: Reference the Data Quality and  Consistency reporting work instructions here.]  -   The individual needing access to the   NSC Reporting tools m ust be   a Jenzabar user with  permissions and appropriate knowledge to utili ze the tool set. Familiarization with the toolset,  and practice utilizing the tool set within the play database are mandatory preconditions.  INSTRUCTIONS   –   MONTHLY ENROLLMENT REPORTING  Locate the NSC   Enrollment   Reporting tools within the Jenzabar   Activity  Center  1.   Open   Jenzabar   EX   and log in   to the system .   Users executing this process should login to the  Jenzabar Group, READMIN.  2.   Locate the “NSC Enrollment Reporting” tools within your Jenzabar Activity Center. See Figure 1. If  you do not see the “N SC Enrollment Reporting” items in your activity center you will need to request  access permissions from the Database Administrator or Registration Module Manager.  Figure 1   –   The NSC Enrollment Reporting Activity Center Run the “NSC Maintain   Student Data Records” tool.  3.   Locate the “NSC Maintain Student Data Records” tool in the activity center.  4.   Click on the “NSC Maintain Student Data Records”   link   to open the tool. See Figure 2.  Figure 2   –   “ NSC Maintain Student Data Records ”   link.  The “NS C Maintain Student Data Records” window will be open. See Figure 3.  Figure 3   –   The “NSC Maintain Student Data Records” window.  5.   Ensure that the “Process Controls” are correct for the Year and Term you are reporting on. If not,  make correct selections   for “Year for Update” and “Term for Update”. In this case, the year and  term are correct as we are reporting on 2017 FA.  6.   Decide whether you want to Create New Student Records or only Update Existing Records. If you  wish to perform   BOTH   the creation of n ew student records and the update of existing records then  check both   check   boxes, “Create New Student Records”   and   “Update Existing Students”.   In most  cases you will want to perform both operations. See figure 4. Figure 4   –   Selecting both the Create and Update student records option.  7.   Next, e nsure that all   desired   “If Update, Overwrite”   options are selected.   Again, selecting all of  these options is recommended because the master stude nt record should be in conformance with  data quality and consistency standards established by RCC. See Figure 5.  These options exist for institutions who do not maintain clean data within their master student  record. For these institutions, their data maintenance tasks are doubled. RCC has made a  conscious decision to keep the master data clean by using the Data Qu ality and Consistency  reports that are available on their Executive Dashboard, SQL Server Reporting Services platform.  The Data Quality and Consistency tools are located   here   and are all prefixed with the characters  “NSC_”.  Because of this, the standard method for running this tool should include both Create and   Update  student records. Figure 5   –   Selecting all of the “If Update, Overwrite” options.  8.   To execute the Maintain Student Data Records process, click on the “Proce ss” button. See Figure 6.  Figure 6   –   The “Process” button.  Wait while the system creates and updates student data records. While updating, the system  displays a task percent complete bar.   See Figure 7.  Figure   7   –   The   Progress Bar.  When completed, the   “NSC Maintain Student Data Records” window will close.  Run the “NSC Edit Student Data Records” tool.  Run ning the “NSC Edit Student Data Records” tool should only be done for extreme situations. Because  RCC is committed to ensuring th at the master student record is correct, editing of the NSC records  should always be done automatically by use of the “NSC Maintain Student Data Records” tool. Reasons  for using this tool will be identified below should the Registrar determine that specia l circumstances  warrant it. See following instructions below.  Special Circumstances and Instructions:  -   There are currently no special circumstances identified to warrant the use of the “NSC Edit  Student Data Records” tool. Run the “NSC Update PT/FT and St atus” tool.  9.   Locate the “NSC   Update PT/FT and Status ” tool in the activity center.  10.   Click on the “NSC   Update PT/FT and Status ” link to open the tool. See Figure 8.  Figure 8   –   The “NSC   Update PT/FT and Status ” link.  The “NSC   Update PT/FT and   Status ” window will be open. See Figure 9.  Figure 9   –   The “NSC   Update PT/FT and Status ” window.  11.   Ensure that the “Year for Update” and “Term for Update” controls have the correct selections for  the year and term of interest.  12.   Leave the “ID #” blank a nd the “Start From This ID” checked. With these settings, the tool will  create any missing registration transaction records for any student enrolled in the specified year and  term. See Figure 9.  13.   Click the OK button to execute the process. There will be   no status bar, but in the lower left corner  of the screen you will find a status prompt as this process cycles through the records. When the  process is complete the window will close.  Run the Rules Base d Updates for NSC.  Note: The   Jenzabar   documentation   recommends that you run the   “NSC   U pdate PT/FT and Status ”  option one final time for the year/term for which a report is being prepared.   The normal  Registration and drop/add procedures will be updating this data   ongoing , but a final \"safety\"  update run is recommended. RCC has determined that running several Rules Based Updates (RBUs) is required within the standard  NSC Reporting process. These RBUs handle special circumstances that the Jenzabar NSC tools are not  designed to address.  The se   RBUs are de signed to remove special status codes and mark specific students for NSC report  exclusion based on   certain attributes that are on their student record  -   Students that have previously graduated from RCC but have returned for additional studies need  to have th e Graduation Special Status removed.  -   Students pursuing studies that do not result in a formal degree must be marked for exclusion.  These are students whose major and degree place them into the category of “Irregular  Students”.  14.   Locate the “ Rules   Based Update ” tool in the activity center.  15.   Click on the “NSC   Update PT/FT and Status ” link to open the tool. See Figure 7.1.  Figure 7.1   –   The “Rules Based Update” link.  The “Rules Based Update”window will be open. See Figure 7.2.  Figure 7.2   –   T he “Rules Based Update” window. 16.   Locate the NSC Clearinghouse Data Update Rules within the “Update Type/Code Selection” list. See  Figure 7.3.  Figure 7.3   –   The NSC Clearinghouse Data Update Rules in the “Update Type/Code Selection” list..  17.   Selec t the “ CLEAR” item then click on the “Select” button to add the “CLEAR” RBU to the “Selected  Items” list. See Figure 7.4  Figure 7.4   –   Select the CLEAR item then click on the “Select” button.  The “CLEAR” RBU will be added to the “Selected Items” list.   See Figure 7.5  Figure 7.5   –   The “CLEAR” item is added to the “Selected Items” list. 18.   Repeat these steps to add the   “CLEAR_W”,   “CLEARDTE” and “NS3” items to the “Selected Items” list.  The “Selected Items” list should have all   4   RBUs showing as selected. See Figure 7.6.  Figure 7. 6 –   The “CLEAR”,   “CLEAR_W”,   “CLEARDTE” and “NS3” items are added to the “Selected  Items” list.  19.   Click on the “Process Criteria”, “Years and Terms” radio button to view the years and terms  currently s elected. This tool defaults to the current year and term. If this needs to be changed, click  on the “Change” button to select the correct Year / Term for processing. See Figure 7.7.  Figure 7.7   –   The Years and Terms Process Criteria.  20.   Move on to   the “Student Selection” area of the screen. In the “Query” drop - down, ensure that the  “d_q_rbu_yr_trm_id” query is selected. Then click on the “Populate Students” button. See Figure  7.8.  Figure 7.8   –   The selected query and “Populate Students” button .  The Students for the selected year and term will be added to the “Selected Items” list. See Figure  7.9. Figure 7.9   –   The students for the selected year and term are added to the “Selected Items” list.  21.   Lastly, recheck your selections by clicking on   the “Process Criteria” radio buttons to verify your  selections are correct: “Years and Terms”, “Types and Codes” and “Query Results”.   See Figure 7.10.  Figure 7.10   –   Rechecking the “Process Criteria”.  22.   Once   verified   you are ready to click the “Process” button to execute the RBU process.   Click the  “Process” button.   See Figure 7.11.  Figure 7.11   –   The “Process” button.  The RBU process will execute. Multiple status bars will be displayed as the tool cycles throug h the  rules and the updates. Once finished, the status bars will be hidden, and the “Rules Based Update”  window will remain. You can now close the “Rules Based Update” window.  Run the “NSC Edit Registration Transactions” tool.  Run ning the “NSC Edit Regi stration Transactions” tool should only be done under exceptional  circumstances. The normal run of the “NSC   Update PT/FT and Status ” tool should produce correct  results. Reasons for using this tool will be identified below should the Registrar determine   that special  circumstances warrant it. See following instructions below.  Special Circumstances and Instructions: -   There are currently no special circumstances identified to warrant the use of the “NSC Edit  Registration Transactions” tool.  Populate Transmittal tables using the “NSC Create Transmittal and Final  Files” tool.  23.   Locate the “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files” tool in the activity center.  24.   Click on the “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files” link to open the tool. See Figur e 10.  Figure 10   –   The “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files” link.  The “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files” window will be open. See Figure 11.  Figure 11   –   The “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files” window.  25.   Set the “Selected Years and   Terms” for the report you are running. The default year and term are  automatically populated based on the values in the registration configuration. If you wish to change  the year and term, click the “Change” button. See figure 12. Figure 12   –   “Sele cted Years and Terms” options.  Note: A normal run of the NSC reporting tools will use the default year and term, so needing to  change these settings is unlikely. Keep in mind it is possible to run multiple years and terms all at  once if the need arises.   In that case, click the “Change” button then select all years and terms to  report on.  26.   Set the “NSC Create Criteria” according to your needs.   See Figure 13.  a.   Always select   01193 0   : 00 for the FICE and Branch codes.  b.   Always select the year and term you   are reporting on. In this case, FA and 2017:Fall because  we are running the report post census date for the fall term.  c.   Enter a certification date for the report. Again, we are running a post census report for the  2017 Fall term so the certification date   is set to 09/18/2017. The census date is 09/16/2017 for  the 2017 Fall term.  d.   Select the “Standard Report” checkbox since this is a standard census report for the 2017 Fall  term.  Figure 13   –   Standard “NSC Create Criteria” selections.  27.   Set the options   for identifying   students as Foreign [“FO”] or Citizens using the “Address Priority and  Report FO State If Country is Not...” and “Student is a US Citizen if Country is” controls. Both of  these should be set to US. And the Address Priority should be set to   default. See Figure 14. Figure 14   –   Foreign and US Citizen Indicators.  28.   Select the “History File to Use for Compare” option. This is typically the last file submitted to NSC.  As this is the first run of NSC reporting using the newly configured tool s, there is no History File to  use for Compare”. See Figure 15.  Figure 15   –   No “History File to Use for Compare” is selected for any initial run of the tool set.  29.   Run the   “Populate Transmittal Table” tool by clicking on the “Populate   Transmittal Tables” button.  After clicking on the button the “Cohort/First Time Source” window will be displayed. See Figures  16 and 17.  Figure 16   –   The “Populate Transmittal Tables” button. Figure 17   –   The “Cohort/First - Time Source”   Window.  30.   Select the “Student Master Entrance Year and Term” option and then click the OK button to  continue. Figure 17 shows the correct selection. Wait while the tool creates the Transmittal Table  entries. A Progress Bar will be displayed. See Figure   18.  Figure 18   –   Progress Bar for Populate Transmittal Tables.  Once the Transmittal tables have been populated, you may see a message box displayed. Typically  this is displayed when exceptions have been identified by the tools.   Click OK to clear the m essage  box.   See Figure 19.  Figure 19   –   Message Box.  Run the NSC_ACTION_Clear_Additional_Degree_Programs report.  31.   Locate the “NSC_ACTION_Clear_Additional_Degree_Programs” report in your Jenzabar Reports  workspace. This is a very special report   tool that technically is not a report at all. This tool executes  a stored procedure on the production database which wipes out additional degree / program  information from the NSLC_Transmittal_Details table. Note: If you do not see this report, you are  n ot a member of the READMIN Jenzabar user group. See Figure 19 - A.  Figure 19 - A   –   The “NSC_ACTION_Clear_Additional_Degree_Programs” report link.  32.   Click on the report link to execute the Stored Procedure. You will need to login using your domain  credenti als. See Figure 19 - B. Figure 19 - B: The SSRS Server Login dialog.  33.   The report will run, executing the stored procedure   and provid ing   a count of the records updated.  See Figure 19 - C .  Figure 19 - C: The SSRS Report displaying the number of   NSLC_Transmittal_Details records affected.  View the Exceptions Re port using the “NSC SSN Exception Report” tool.  34.   Locate the “NSC SSN Exception Report” tool in the activity center.  35.   Click on the “NSC SSN Exception Report” link to open the tool. See Figure 20.  Note: This step is required because RCC has a legacy of storing special program attributes for  students within the degree history major 2 field. These attributes include but are not limited to:  Commonwealth C ommitment In Progress, Destination College, Boston Public School Free Tuition  Program, School of Re - Entry . None of these are valid programs of study and must not be reported  to NSC. They will cause errors to be returned from NSC. Figure 20   –   The “NSC SSN Exception Report” link.  The “NSC   SSN Exception Report” window will be open. See Figure 21.  Figure 21   –   The “NSC SSN Exception Report” window.  Select the “Preview” option and click the “OK” button. The   “Print NSC Exception Report” window  will be displayed. S ee Figure 2 2 .  Figure 22   –   The “Print NSC Exception Report” window.  Optional:   View the Transmittal Detail and Trailer Records.  36.   If desired, you can view the transmittal detail and trailer record s prior to submission. Locate the  “NSC Edit Transmittal Detail Records” link in your Jenzabar workspace. See Figure 23.  Note: If proper pre - NSC reporting procedures are followed, the likelihood of any exceptions being  generated are minimal. In this case, the NSC reporting process was initiated prior to ensuring that  all student records had been reviewed for completeness. Even if the Data Quality and Consistency  checks are executed faithfully, it is still possible that some data could not be obtained. In this  case, the NSC tools will still transmit these records to t he National Student Clearinghouse. It may  be worthwhile to stop here and attempt to obtain the missing data for these students. Figure 23   –   The “NSC Transmittal Detail Records” link.  37.   Click on the “NSC Edit Transmittal Detail Records” link. The “NSC Edit Tr ansmittal Detail Records”  window will be displayed. Note: This window allows you to edit the detail records but t his practice  is not recommended. If the detail records are incorrect, it is wiser to identify and correct the root  cause.  Review the records   to make sure things look reasonable. Investigate anything that looks out of  place. If you don’t like something you see, ask questions. Perhaps a step was missed while running  this process. Exact conformance to the sequential steps contained in this wo rk instruction along  with diligent use of the Data Quality and Consistency reports should guarantee consistent and  accurate reporting to NSC.  38.   Click on the “NSC Transmittal Trailer Records” link to open the “NSC Edit Transmittal Trailer  Records” window.   See Figure 24.  Figure 2 4   –   The “NSC Transmittal Trailer Records” link.  39.   The “NSC Edit Transmittal Trailer Records” window will be displayed.   Note: This window allows you  to edit the trailer records but this practice is not recommended. The counts will be correct if the  tools were utilized correctly and as designed.  Create the final Transmittal files using the “NSC Create Transmittal and  Fi nal Files” tool.  40.   Locate the “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files” tool in the activity center.  41.   Click on the “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files” link to open the tool. See Figure 25.  Figure 25   –   The “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files”   link.  The “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files” window will be open. See Figure 26. Figure 26   –   The “NSC Create Transmittal and Final Files” window.  42.   Navigate to the “Prepare Final File(s)” tab. See Figure 27.  Figure 27   –   The   “Prepare Final File(s)” tab.  43.   Select the FICE and Branch code from the drop - down menu.   See Figure 28.  Figure 28   –   The “FICE and Branch” selection. 44.   Click on the “Create History Rows and Final Transmittal File...” button to create the final files. See  Fi gure 29.  Figure 29   –   The “Create History Rows and Final Transmittal File...” button.  You will be prompted to name the file. It is alright to simply click the OK button as Jenzabar will add  the Certification Date to the file name. But you are free to n ame the file whatever you like. See  Figure 30.  Figure 30   –   The “NSC Transmittal File” file naming dialog.  45.   Click the “OK” button. Two status bars will be displayed as the final transmittal file is being  generated. Once the file is create d , the window will switch itself to the   “View/Send Final Files” tab,  and the final file will be displayed in the viewer. See figure 31.  Figure 31   –   The transmittal file viewer. 46.   Click the “Secure FTP” button to send the file to the NSC FTP site. If t his functionality is not working,  you can upload the file manually by going to NSC’s FTP page, clicking the Upload Wizard, locating  your file, and finalizing the upload from NSC’s interface. See Figure 32.  Figure 32   –   The “Secure FTP” button.  47.   Login   to the NSC FTP site to make sure that your file was submitted.  INSTRUCTIONS   –   DEGREE VERIFICATION REPORTING  Locate the NSC Enrollment Reporting tools within the Jenzabar Activity  Center  1.   Open   Jenzabar   EX   and log in   to the system .   Users executing this process should login to the  Jenzabar Group, READMIN.  2.   Locate the “NSC Enrollment Reporting” tools within your Jenzabar Activity Center. See Figure 1. If  you do not see the “NSC Enrollment Reporting” items in your activity center you   will need to request  access permissions from the Database Administrator or Registration Module Manager.  Figure 33   –   The NSC Enrollment Reporting Activity Center Open   the “NSC   Degree Verification Data Collection and Transmission ”  tool.  3.   Locate the “NSC   Degree Verification Data Collection and Transmission” tool. Click on this link to  open the tool. See Figure 34.  Figure 34   –   The “NSC Degree Verification Data Collection and Transmission” tool link.  The “NSC Degree Verification Data Collection and T ransmission” window will be displayed as will the  “NSC Records Select Batch” window. See Figure 35.  Figure 35   –   The “NSC Degree Verification Data Collection and Transmission” window and the “NSC  Records Select Batch” window.  4.   Either select an existing   batch to work with or use the “New Batch” button to create a new batch.  a.   To open an existing batch, select the batch from the list then click the “OK” button.  b.   To create a new batch, click the “New Batch” button. If creating a new batch you will  need to   select the “FICE / Branch” code and “Degree Period” from the drop - down  menus. See Figures 36 and 37. Figure 36   –   The “FICE / Branch” code selection.  Figure 37   –   The “Degree Period” selection.  Save the new batch by clicking on the “Save”   button in the upper left - hand corner of the  Jenzabar screen.  Populate the NSC Tables.  5.   Ensure you are on the “Collect Data” tab.  6.   Make appropriate selections for the “Select Action”, “Query Source”, “Rules Based” updates, and  “Foreign Students” options   groups.   Figure 38 shows the recommended selections. You may  determine that alternative selections are more appropriate for your reporting needs.  Figure 38   –   Recommended data collection options. 7.   Once your options are selected, click the “Populate NSC   Tables” button to initiate the data collection  process. See figure 39.  Figure 39   –   The “Populate NSC Tables” button.  A message may be displayed warning that the records will be overwritten. If you have made  changes to the data within an existing batch, you will   may not   want to overwrite your changes with  fresh data. Make an appropriate selection based on what you are t rying to accomplish. See Figure  40.  Figure 40   –   Data overwrite warning message.  You may also see an additional warning message indicating that “NSC History records DO NOT exist  for previous batch...”. Click the “Yes” to proceed with populating the NSC   History table, the “No”  button to Proceed without populating the NSC History Table, or the “Cancel” button to abort the  process. Make an appropriate selection based upon what you are trying to accomplish. See Figure  41.  Figure 41   –   Data overwrite war ning message.  The   process will run. Upon finishing a “Process Completed Successfully” window will appear. See  Figure 42. Figure 42   –   The Process Completed message.  Click the OK button to close the message box. Focus will shift to the “Detail Reco rds” tab of the  “NSC Degree Verification Data Collection and Transmission” window. See Figure 43.  Figure 43   –   The “Detail Records” tab.  Review the Collected Data  8.   While on the “Detail Records” tab you should review the data collected. You may   also edit the data  within this window, but this is not recommended.  9.   Next, go to the “Header Records” tab and briefly examine the header data for your transmittal. This  information may also be edited, but there should be no reason to do so. See Figure 44.  Figure 44   –   The “Header Records” tab.  10.   Review the trailer record by selecting the “Trailer Records” tab. This information may also be  edited, but there should be no reason to do so. See Figure 45. Figure 45   –   The “Trailer Records” tab.  Create the   Transmittal and Send to NSC  11.   Once you are satisfied with the data to be transmitted, you can create the Transmittal files and also  save the data to the transmittal history table. Go to the “Prepare Final File” tab. See Figure 46.  Figure 46   –   The “Pre pare Final File” tab.  12.   To create the final transmittal file, click on the “Create Final Transmittal File” button. A file dialog  will be displayed. You can modify the file name if you like, otherwise just click the “OK” button. See  Figure 47.  Figure 4 7   –   The file dialog  13.   Once you click the OK button, the file will be created. After the file is created, the tab will switch to  the “View / Send Final File” tab. See Figure 48. Figure 48   –   The “View / Send Final File” tab.  14.   If you wish to send the   file immediately, click on the “Secure FTP” button. This will send the file to  NSC.  15.   Don’t forget to create the NSC History records. Go back to the “Prepare Final File” tab. Check the  “Update Degree History” checkbox if you wish to Lock the Degree Histor y record and also set the  Degree Period Column simultaneously. See Figure 49.  Figure 49   –   The “Update Degree History” checkbox.  When you have made your selections, click on the “Create NSC History Records” button. A progress  bar will be displayed as   the NSC History Records are being created. See Figure 50.  Figure 50   –   The Progress Bar.  Once the History records are created, the Progress Bar will disappear. Effectively, you are now  finished with the Degree Verification submittal process. END OF W ORK INSTRUCTIONS Revision History  Version 1.0   –   08/28/2017   –   Author, John Franklin: :  First draft of Work Instructions prior to initial analysis of results. Developed per the recommendations  obtained from the “Reporting For NSC Quick Guide”.  Version 1.1   -   08/30/2017   –   Modified by, John Franklin: :  Second draft of Work Instructions post initial analysis. Determined that we needed to add steps to run  Rules Based Updates that would take care of removing the Special Status and Status date for Gr aduat ed  students that had returned for additional studies. Also added the Rules Based Update for Exclude  Indicator which marks both Irregular Students and NC division students as Excluded   from NSC reporting .  Version 1.2   -   09/ 25 /2017   –   Modified by, John F ranklin:  Changed the order of execution. Placed the “Rules Based Updates” to occur AFTER the “NSC Update  PT/FT and Status” step because the “NSC Update PT/FT and Status” step remarked students as  graduated which defeated the purpose of the RBU run.   Repla ced graphics in the Rules Based Update  section to match revised work instructions.  Ad ded   a   step to run   the   special SSRS report that will blank out all addit ional programs data in the NSLC  Transmittal   Details table. This is necessary because RCC only wants   to report a single program of study.  This is by policy.  Added instructions for viewing transmittal details, trailer   records   and creation and upload of final files to  NSC.  Version 1.3   -   01/05/2018   –   Modified by, John Franklin:  Added work instruction for   executing the Degree Verification Reporting process.  -",
