June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Presented by  Sarah Bucklew, Jenzabar  Thursday, June 2 nd , 2016 | 8:00am - 8:45am  #1548 | Advising Alterations: Who, What, Why, How??? © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  What   is   this session about?   Advising Alterations   Definition   Configuration   When/How to Use Them   When/How to Avoid Them ;)   Questions   &   Answers  SESSION OVERVIEW © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Advising Alterations are   adjustments we make to affect the results of the Compute  Student Progress process on an individual student basis.     Advising Alterations are not changes we implement on a “global” scale and as a  general principle, should be considered exceptions to the rule, not the rule.     The most common types of Advising Alterations are     Course Substitutions     Requirement Waivers     Other Adjustments   ( Hours/Count/GPA/Grade/Priority)     Bypasses  DEFINITIONS © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  CONFIGURATION: SETTINGS   –   ADVISING  Maintain Requirement Met - By Types     What kinds of alterations will you  make?     What codes do you want to use to  represent those alterations?  Advising Configuration     Do you want to track who approved  the alteration? © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  CONFIGURATION: SETTINGS   –   ADVISING, PERMISSIONS  Maintain Advising Access     Add each user who will enter  alterations, and assign the  Administrator access type  Group Permissions     Add Function ID 70065 to all EX user  groups which contain users who will  enter alterations © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  WHEN/HOW:  SUBSTITUTIONS  •   Use to satisfy a specific course  requirement with a different course  •   Substitution Requirement   drop - down  displays in - progress/completed  coursework  •   Show All Course Requirements   checkbox  enables the drop - down to show all course  ARCs  •   Can be entered before/after the  substitution has been completed  •   Earned hours/quality points/GPA/grade  must match the corresponding “needed”  values on the original requirement  •   Don’t enter a value into the   Met   column  •   Don’t use this in place of adding OR groups  to your trees!!! © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  WHEN/HOW:  WAIVERS  •   Use   to   meet a requirement (course or  group) that won’t otherwise be met  •   Will   not   count as earned hours towards  the parent group/root  •   May require additional alterations at the  parent group/root level (to   decrease   hours  needed), as well as an adjustment to  *FREE aim (to   increase   hours needed)  •   Consider using different Requirement Met -  By codes to track varying kinds of waivers  for long term reporting purposes, like:  •   Work Experience  •   Life Experience  •   Select   Yes   from the   Met   drop - down  •   Can be avoided in some cases, using  Advising RBUs and OR groups © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  WHEN/HOW:  OTHER ALTERATIONS  •   Use   to   alter the hours/count needed, max  hours/count, quality points needed, GPA  needed, grade needed, or priority 1/2  columns  •   Can be used to enter bypasses (otherwise  define a Requirement Met - By code to be  used specifically for bypasses)  •   Can be used on any kind of ARC (course,  group, root, etc.)  •   Is sometimes used in conjunction with  other alterations  •   Can be avoided in some cases, using clever  tree tricks:  •   Removing Hours Needed values and using  Count Needed instead  •   Setting your reuse priorities appropriately  •   Setting your grade priorities appropriately © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  WHEN/HOW:  BYPASSES  •   Use when you want to “skip over” a  course requirement in order to “push” a  course toward the next available  requirement  •   Can be avoided in some cases, by  reassigning priority values according to  student trends © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  TIPS & TRICKS   –   Q&A  Tips & Tricks     Sometimes the highlighted ARC is not the ARC your mouse  is actually clicked on; click in the   Description   box on the  right side of the Student Progress window to get the  highlight to “catch up” to your mouse     Sometimes Other alterations get stuck after you’ve tried to  delete them; revert whatever column you altered to what  the original ARC requires, click OK, run the   recalc , then go  back into the alteration and delete it     Course substitutions for cumulative course ARCs in OR  groups do not behave as expected when WMTM is  enabled; even though your reuse priorities/status are  configured correctly, you may find that substituting one  course for one of the cumulative courses results in all of  the cumulative courses being met. A work - around for this  is to define non - cumulative course ARCs to put into OR  groups to be used for this purpose.     By default, the Advising Worksheet does not display text  you enter in the Comment Text field (up to 30 characters),  however you can easily add this text to the computed  object used in the nested report.     Data in the STUD_ADV_ALTER table does not get deleted  when a student is assigned new aims (either by the trigger  that fires off when you make changes to the student’s  Degree History row, or by the Synchronize Advisee  Information process), however if the net result of either  process is that the student ends up with different aims, it  is likely that they will no longer apply, and thus no longer  be visible through the EX application. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.
