Shared resources  include Servers, Network   infrastructure ,   and hosted   Applications   which campus stakeholders require for normal  operations. Single instance, workstation configurations are not in scope   for this policy.  IT professionals (and   certain   staff members) enjoy elevated systems   configuration   privileges   that must be  wielded with caution. Those with elevated privileges   can implement changes that are beneficial or harmful.  And while the intent is   always benevolent, unforeseen , negative consequences   frequently arise from system  changes.  Negative impacts may   be widespread or isolated. Some impacts are noticed immediately while others are felt  after several days , and some are not noticed for weeks or months .   Regardless of the breadth or severity of the  impact, all outages/service interruptions must be repaired   or mitigated . And they   must   be repaired as quickly as  possible.  All troubleshooting efforts start with the same questions: “What has changed? When was the change made?  Who made the change? Can we reverse the   change, or should we adapt to it ?”  Experienced IT   professionals   understand their capacity to effect positive o r   negative change and are in the habit  of keep ing track of such changes for themselves. This policy builds on individual professionalism and extends  the record - keeping practice to   the organizational level. This level of shared knowledge, transparency and  professional courtesy positions   the RCC technical team for effective and timely mitigation of systems outages .  By logging system changes proactively, the following benefits may be realized:  -   Likely root cause s   can be   explored and   identified   by other members of the technical team.  -   R educ ed need for   “email - blasting” to uncover relevant facts   from technical team members .  -   Increased privacy of   communication s   with   principal   change   actors .   Less emotional stress. Better  opportunity for constructive, collaborative problem solving.  -   Faster repair/restoration of service.  REQUIRED PARTICIPA TION  Participation is required of all persons serving RCC, either directly employed, employed by way of contractual  agreement, or employed by way of volunteer ism /internship s   and who are serving RCC   in   any of   the following  role s /capacities :  -   Domain Administrators  -   Server Administrators  -   Database Administrators  -   Bulk Data   Administrators   –   Record manipulations within any database system ( Create, Update, Delete)  -   Storage Administrators -   Applications Administrators  -   Security Administrators  -   Module Managers or those with Module Administration/Configuration privileges  -   Learning Management System Administrators  -   Customer   Relationship Management System Administrators  -   Software Developers  -   Web Developers  -   Web Designers  -   Web Content   Managers/ Developers  -   Report Writers  -   Business Analysts  -   Help Desk Technicians  SCOPE   -   EVENTS TO BE LOGGED  System changes on shared resource s   must be logged.   Shared resource s include Servers, Network infrastructure  components , and hosted Applications   (on - prem or cloud) . Individual workstations are excluded unless the  workstation has become a de facto server for other users within the organization.  While not inclusive of all   events requiring System Change Journal entries, the following list captures the essence  of the types of   change   records   RCC   consider s   to be of value.   Any competent IT professional already understand s  which types of   change s can lead to service interruptions   to stakeholders . Therefore, all such events   are to   be  logged whether they   are   included   on the list or not.   When in doubt err on the side of caution.  Specific E vents Requiring Change Journal Entries:  -   Server Builds   /   Sundowning   / Replacements  -   IP address changes  -   DNS entry changes  -   Security certificate changes  -   S oftware deployment s   / i nstallation s .  -   Software upgrades.  -   Software configuration changes   including module - level   configuration   settings .  -   C ode logic   introduction/ modification   (includes batch files, PowerShell scripts, Scheduled Tasks,   database  stored procedures/views, workflow changes , etc . )  -   User f orms   creation /   modification.  -   Report modifications.  -   Bulk data manipulations   (Create, Update, Delete) .  -   Database view creation, modification, deletion.  -   Database restores / refreshes.  -   Database maintenance task modification.  -   Database job changes.  -   Service   or Administrative   account changes (group memberships, password changes, account  expirations)  -   Web content redesign, page deployment / sundowning, URL changes, etc.  METHOD   -   LOGGING  All   qualifying   systems changes are to be logged to the shared “ Systems Changes Journal ”, SharePoint calendar. Access to the calendar has been granted to all IT Staff by way of the Active Directory   “ IT_Staff ”   group.  Additionally, the RCC \\ Jenzabar1 active directory account has also been granted access. This enables the  Jenzabar Managed Services team to participate.  1)   Navigate to the RCC Teams/SharePoint platform at teams.microsoft.com. You must login using RCC  credentials.  2)   Navigate to the   “ Systems Changes Journal ” page.  3)   Start a new entry by clicking the “ +   Add” control on the   calendar page.  4)   Enter the details of the system change.  a.   Title (a brief name for the system change entry) .  b.   Location (the server or system where the change was made) .  c.   Start Time   (provide an accurate start time for the change activity)  d.   End   Time (provide an accurate end time for the change activity)  e.   Description (the full details of the change in narrative format. Be as detailed as necessary to  convey the substance of the change that was made. This should be of sufficient detail to allow  another technical resource to follow what was done.   If logged in as RCC \\ Jenzabar1, please  provide the actual name of the actual change agent for clarity ) .  f.   Category (select from   drop - down list or add your own category value).  g.   Contact Person (the user who created the change journal entry).  h.   Click the “Check Names” control to ensure the “Contact Person” can be located in   Active  Directory . i.   Save the entry.  METHOD   –   UTILIZATION DURING SYSTEM OUTAGE  Whenever a system outage is reported, it is likely that a recent change may have initiated the event.  Review the “ Systems Changes Journal ”, to see if any recent event might correlate strongly to the system outage  event. If any correlations are found, contact the change agent   to determine next - steps and collaborate on a  resolution.  If no correlating events are found, proceed to poll additional IT resources for information about potential  unrecorded systems changes that may have occurred recently. Once a root cause or correlating event is  identified be sure to enter it into the Syste ms Changes Journal for future reference. Also, do not forget to  record the system outage and steps taken to mitigate the outage within the Systems Changes Journal.  1.   END OF WORK INSTRUCTIONS",
