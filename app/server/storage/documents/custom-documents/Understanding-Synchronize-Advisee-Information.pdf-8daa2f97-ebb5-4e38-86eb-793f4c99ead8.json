The Synchronize Advisee Information process is a query-based process which can be used to insert rows into five tables:     Advisee Master (ADV_MASTER;   Maintain Advisees   window)     Advisor Student Table (ADVISOR_STUD_TABLE;   Advisors for Student   window)     Student Aims (STUD_AIMS;   Maintain Student Aims   window)     Student Plan (AVStudentPlan; visible in EXi)     GPA Profile Student Master (EX_PROGRAM_GPA_STUDENT_MASTER;   Program GPA Profiles for Student   window)  The process is typically used at go-live, for institutions which have just implemented the Jenzabar EX ERP system and will be using the EX Advising module for the first time. For institutions which have been live with the module for some time, the process is used either for mass maintenance purposes, or because there has been a gap in module use. December 2015 2 Page  I.   THE GENERAL TAB  The   General   tab of the   Synchronize Advisee Information   window allows you to select a query to determine which students the process will update. The default <Original> query pulls IDs who have a row in the Student Term Summary table with year and term values that match the values identified in the   Current Year   and   Current Term   columns in the   Registration Configuration   window.  Many institutions must modify the query to accommodate their needs; for example, if they ’ ve only built trees for one catalog year, they may wish to modify the query to pull only current students who are under the catalog they ’ ve built trees for, rather than all current students.  To modify the query, complete the following steps:  1.   From the   Synchronize Advisee Information   window, click the   Customize   button to launch InfoMaker  2.   Log in to InfoMaker (if applicable), then go to   File > Save As  3.   Append the name of the query by adding an underscore after the word info, along with any additional keywords that explain who the query is designed to pull, and click   OK  4.   Click the   icon to move to the Data Source side of the report, where you will modify the query by adding tables and Where clauses as necessary  5.   Click the   icon to preview and verify your query results; keep in mind that only the ID should be returned by the query  6.   Once you ’ re satisfied with the results of your query, click the   icon to return to the Design side of the report  7.   Click the   icon to save your customized query once more, now that you ’ ve made changes  8.   Close InfoMaker and return to EX  9.   Close the   Synchronize Advisee Information   window and re-open it to refresh the   Query:   drop- down; click in the drop-down to verify your query appears (you may need to scroll to see it)  II.   THE OPTIONS TAB   –   CREATE ADVISEES  The   Options   tab of the   Synchronize Advisee Information   window allows you to control exactly which steps the process moves through as it runs, ensuring you have control over which tables are affected by the synch.  The   Create Advisee Information   checkbox ensures that the first table updated by the synch process is the Advisee Master table (ADV_MASTER,   Maintain Advisees   window).  For institutions implementing EX Advising for the first time, this step is essential because it is the initial load of students into the Advising module.  For institutions which have used the Advising module for some time, this step simply ensures that no students have been missed. The process will not add an ID to the table more than once, so you can ’ t end up with duplicates in the table. December 2015 3 Page  You can view the results of the first step in the process from the   Maintain Advisees   window — after the process runs, use the yellow search fields to search for a particular ID (or name) you expected the process to add:  III.   THE OPTIONS TAB   –   SYNCHRONIZE ADVISOR/STUDENT RELATIONSHIPS  The   Synchronize with Student Division Master  checkbox allows the process to copy the advisors assigned on the Student Division Master table ( Student Division   tab of the   Student Information  window) to the Advisors for Student table (bottom half of the   Advising   tab of the   Student Information   window). Advisors must be assigned to the Advisors for Student table in order to have access to the student ’ s information in JICS and EXi. The process can copy the advisors from all Student Division Master rows or just for the row in the table that  matches the student’s   Current Division   as indicated on the Student Master table ( Student   tab in the  Student Information   window). Depending on how your institution uses divisions, you may wish to deselect the   Current Division Only?   checkbox in order to copy all advisor assignments to the Advisors for Student table. At many institutions, only the advisors assigned based on the student ’ s   Current Division  need to be copied, therefore this checkbox is selected by default.  If you are an institution which has been live with the module for some time, you may be using the Synchronize Advisee Information process   not   for the purpose of copying advisor assignments, but rather for the purpose of assigning aims, GPA profiles, or academic plans. You may also be using a different method for assigning advisors, such as the Synchronize Advising Groups process. If the reason for December 2015 4 Page  running the Synchronize Advisee Information process is not to assign/update advisors, you may want to deselect both checkboxes so that you can avoid disrupting data in the Advisors for Student table (ADVISOR_STUD_TABLE).  You can see the results of this step of the process from the   Student Information   window, comparing the advisors who appear on the   Student Division   tab with those who appear on the bottom half of the  Advising   tab:  Alternatively, you can view just the Advisors for Student table via right-click from the   Maintain Advisees  window December 2015 5 Page  IV.   THE OPTIONS TAB   –   SYNCHRONIZE AIMS  The   Synchronize Aims with Degree History   checkbox determines whether the process will assign aims to the students selected by your query. This checkbox is not selected by default. When selected, the process first deletes all rows from the Student Aims table (for the students selected by your query) and then reinserts rows according to the Degree/Aim Cross Reference table by evaluating the following data elements on each row in the Degree History table ( Degree   tab of the   Student Information   window) where the   Active   checkbox is selected:   Degree ,  Major(s) ,   Certification(s) ,   Minor(s) ,   Concentration(s) , and   Advising Institutional Requirement Year .  The combination of these elements is compared to the corresponding   Master   rows in the   Degree/Aim Cross Reference   window, and the aims identified in the   Detail   section of the window are assigned as rows inserted into the Student Aims table ( Maintain Student Aims   window).  In the screenshot above, the student is assigned a BS   Degree   code, a BSBUS   Major   code, and the  Advising Institutional Requirement Year   2015. December 2015 6 Page  In the screenshot below, the highlighted row in the   Master   section of the   Degree/Aim Cross Reference  window reflects this combination of codes while the   Detail   section of the window identifies the aims to be assigned:  For this step in the synchronization process to be successful, the students selected by your query must be coded with the same codes indicated in the   Master   section of the window. Additionally, the  Requirements   indicated in the   Detail   section of the window must exist in the   Institutional Requirement Trees   window in the   Year   indicated in the   Master   section of the window, with the exception of the total credit aim (if applicable), which must only exist in the   Maintain Advising Requirements   window, and should   not   exist in the   Institutional Requirement Trees   window.  You can see the results of this step of the process in the upper half of the   Advising   tab of the   Student Information   window: December 2015 7 Page  V.   SYNCHRONIZE GPA PROFILES  The   Synchronize GPA Profiles with Degree History  checkbox determines whether the process will assign GPA Profiles to the students selected by your query. This checkbox is not selected by default. When selected, the process first deletes all rows from the EX Program GPA Profile Student Master and Detail tables (for the students selected by your query) and then reinserts rows according to the EX Program GPA Profile Master and Detail tables ( Maintain Program GPA Profiles   window) by evaluating the following data elements on each row in the Degree History table ( Degree   tab of the   Student Information   window) where the   Active   checkbox is selected:   Degree ,   Major(s) ,   Certification(s) ,   Minor(s) ,   Concentration(s) , and   Advising Institutional Requirement Year .  You can see the results of this step of the process in the   Program GPA Profiles for Student   window, which is accessible via right-click from the   Maintain Advisees   window. December 2015 8 Page  VI.   SYNCHRONIZE STUDENT PLANS  The   Synchronize Student Plans with Degree History   checkbox determines whether the process will assign Academic Plans to the students selected by your query. This checkbox is not selected by default. When selected, the process first deletes all rows from the AVStudentPlanStatus, AVStudentPlan, and AVStudentPlanDetails tables, and then reinserts rows according to the Degree/Aim Cross Reference table by evaluating the following data elements on each row in the Degree History table ( Degree   tab of the   Student Information   window) where the   Active   checkbox is selected:   Degree ,   Major(s) ,   Certification(s) ,   Minor(s) ,   Concentration(s) , and  Advising Institutional Requirement Year .  Student Plans are used in EXi Advising to help students know when they should complete the courses and options within their program of study. You can view the results of this step in the process via EXi.",
