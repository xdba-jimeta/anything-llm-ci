PURPOSE  This work instruction covers how   to utilize the Account Verification Report   for the COE supporting Roxbury   students and  employees.   This report was developed   so that   the Center of Excellence   would   have the ability to retrieve necessary  student and employee data for identification purposes.  THE INITIAL ACCESS  Users must   have VPN access and be connected to the Roxbury network   via GlobalProtect   to access this   reporting   tool.  The report is located at the following link :  http://report.rcc.mass.edu/Reports/report/Jenzabar%20EX%20Reports/Reports/Dashboards/Executive%20Dashboard/I  nformation%20Technology/COE_Account_Verification  U SING THE   REPORT  The   report is   designed to   return student or employee data, with retrieval criteria being the SIS ID Number   OR   a  combination of   Last   and   First N ame s .   It is important to note that due to   the   HR   department   maintaining   employee data  outside the SIS, there   is little data available to retrieve.   In   the absence   of PII data   for employees , the report will provide  (if available) the personal email address   and courses in which they are assigned as the instructor . For both students and  employees, a Latest Term Enrolled/Teac hing field will identify the most recent   year and term combination.  Both   students   and   employees   are assigned an SIS ID Number. If   they do not know their ID Number, a   Last   and   First   name  will be required to retrieve the record.   There may be many instances   in which   individuals will   have the same   Last and  First names .   In these cases,   m ultiple records will be retrieved for further identification.  See below for various examples   of returned data.  1.   This is the initial view of the report to enter an ID Number or   a Last   and   First Name combination to retrieve a  record.   All retrieval fields should be cleared before searching for the next individual.  Figure 1   –   Report Landing Page 2   |   P a g e  2.   The following is an example of a student record retrieved with an ID Number   with   much of   their information  available.   Courses that the student is enrolled in for the latest term are displayed with the Course ID and  Description.  Figure 2   –   Student   Data by ID   Number Retrieval  3.
