territory control in the Admissions Administration module.  4   Go to the   Edit Territory Rank   window  o   If you   do not   want to use a component, enter a   0   in the Rank column  o   If you   do want to use a component, enter a number in sequential order depending on its rank  In the illustration displayed to the right, the State component will be used first and the Zip will be used next – therefore, territories will be assigned to counselors first by State and then by Zip. None of the other components will be used.  If you are using more than one component, you will want to start with the highest -  ranking component (lower number) and work up to the lower ranking component (higher number).  Since we have identified both the State and Zip for territory control, the next step is to identify the State for each counselor (since this is the highest-ranking component).  5   Go to the

provided, the   L   configuration has been selected – therefore, the   Graduation Year   on the   Candidate tab   will display the   Graduation Year   that has been identified for the Last Organization as illustrated below:  When you identify a High School on the   Candidate tab   without a Last Organization Attended, the High School ID number will be automatically copied into the Last Organization Attended field.  When Org Tracking does not exist for a candidate, a record will be created using the Last High School or the Last Organization Attended depending on where the ID was entered.  The opposite is also true – that is, if you change the Last High School on Org Tracking or Org Master, the ID numbers on the   Candidate   tab will be updated.

the criteria you have defined for stages  A new record is created for each stage in which a candidate enters – therefore, you can always track the date when a candidate left one stage and entered another.  You can create as many stages as necessary to fit your institutional requirements – the Admissions module includes one default stage of APPLCN (Application). Each stage must belong to one of the seven pre-defined stage levels.

For all stages except those that belong to the   Defer To   or   Defer From   level, you can identify requirements for validation purposes, check acceptance levels, add action lists, and move candidates to another stage if requirements are met.  Defer To/Defer From  You may have a situation where a candidate has been accepted into your school and, for some reason, will not be attending when originally anticipated- in this case, you can use the   Defer To   stage.  When a candidate is moved into the   Defer  To   stage, you may receive a message as shown to the right.  A   Defer From   candidacy will automatically be created. Requirements and any other data that was in the original stage will be copied into the new   Defer From   stage which is editable.  The Defer To candidacy record will be identified as 'deferred' and will be available in  READ ONLY mode. No actions can be performed on a candidacy in the Defer To stage.

ANDIDATES AND   C RITERIA  Before beginning this process, you may want to create a Transfer user with function security granted for the   Admissions to Registration Transfer   window. In this way, any person processing this transfer can log in as Transfer user and automatically be granted the appropriate permissions.  The process of   pushing   data from Admissions into Registration or   pulling   data into Registration from Admissions consists of a multitude of options. These options will allow you to identify the exact data that will become part of the student's degree history record.

If   Expected Grad Year/Term   is selected, you will need to enter the year and term here.  Only available if you are licensed for EX Advising, you can use the   Adv Institutional Req  checkbox to update the Advising Tree Year Code in the Degree History table and create aims for the selected Major or Certification.  The ID number, Division, Degree (only if not completed) and Degree Earned at *LOCAL will be updated accordingly if the appropriate radio button is selected.
