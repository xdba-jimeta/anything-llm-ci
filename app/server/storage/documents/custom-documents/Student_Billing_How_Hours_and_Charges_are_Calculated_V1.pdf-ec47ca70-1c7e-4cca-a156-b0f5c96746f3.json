Hours Codes are also called “Buckets.” Think of them as buckets  of different   broad types   of credits or revenue. Students may have their credit hours in more than one bucket at a time.  You can also introduce variables in the way you calculate credit hours, tuition hours or course counts by manipulating  data in the Hours Table. However, it is   recommended to keep this practice to a minimum so students understand their  statement of tuition and fees.   Transparency with tuition and fees is definitely Best Practice. It appears RCC uses a  straight credit hour calculation to determine hours.   Most colleges follow this protocol for simplicity sake. Below is an  example of how Hours Bucket #4 tracks “Evenin g” course hours. All courses that are designated as Evening Courses will  have credits tracked here. 4  When you open Bucket #4 you see the following. This designates which tables and fields are to be used in the hours  calculation (similar to the SQL Select Statements).  Be sure to note the 3 rows above. 5  When you click on the “Detail” tab for any of the Hours buckets, you may create criteria to determine which credits fall  into each bucket. “Hours Element” #1 corresponds to row #1 on the above image.   Hours Element 2 corresponds to  Row # 2 above, etc.  So, from the above example, we know that when a student is currently enrolled (C) in a class (Hours Element #1), that is  designated as an evening (E) class (Hours Element #2), in the UG Division (Hours Element #3), the credits will be dropped  into Hours bu cket #4. Credit hours   may   be in more than one bucket at a time. For example, if a student is taking a 3  credit course in the afternoon and a 3 credit course in the   evening, they will have 3 hours in bucket #4 and 3 hours in a  the daytime hours bucket.  So...now that we know how the credits fall into this particular hours bucket, let’s look at how evening tuition is charged. 6  Open the “Charges” table, and open Charge Code “EE.” 7  Similar to the Hours table, this screen looks at which Table and Field will be used to calculate charges.   Note that this  charge is looking in the Biograph Master Table and at the Entrance Code field for the student (In - state, Regional,  International or o ut - of - state)   AND   Hours Bucket #4. 8  When you click on the “Detail” tab you see the following.  Jenzabar looks first at the Entrance Code in the Biograph Master, and then looks to see if the student has credits in  Hours Bucket #4. If the student has an “R” in the biograph_master.entrance_cde and has credits in Hours bucket #4, it  assesses a $39 per   credit charge against the student. If the student is in a 3 credit evening course and a 3 credit  afternoon course, they will be charged for $39 x 3 credits = $117 for evening tuition. The afternoon course will be  calculated separately. Evening Fees, Day time Tuition, Technology Fees, etc. are all calculated separately under different  Charge Codes.  Each time charges are generated, Jenzabar looks at a students’ class schedule and runs each registered course through  the Hours table and then through the Charges table to come up with a statement of charges. 9  UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT FEE STRUCTURE  The following section will walk through each Hours “bucket,” each charge code and sample of refund codes to explain  the current system configuration. Each of these items change from time - to - time so it is advisable to review and update  this document annual ly.  HOURS BUCKET #1  Hours Bucket #1.   This is looking at each UG credit course a student is registered in. This bucket is essentially a roll - up of  all the credits for each student. All credits the student is registered for will reside here, regardless of day, evening or  region. 10  **Be aware this is looking at UG courses only. If a course is listed in the wrong division, the hours calculation will not  recognize the course and calculate it in the above hours calculation. 11  HOURS BUCKET # 2  Hours Bucket #2   is similar to #1 (rows 1 and 3 are identical), however it is looking at each course to determine if it is a  day or evening course. 12  HOURS BUCKET # 4  Hours Bucket #4.   Note this uses the same initial calculation as Bucket #2. However, on the detail screen be sure to note  this is looking for ONLY evening courses. Again, if either row is found to be “True” on the Detail Screen, the hours will be  deposited in Bucket #4. 13  HOURS BUCKET # 6  Bucket #6   –   Non - Credit courses. The Master Screen shows this calculation is looking at the course status AND will look  for courses in a particular division. The Detail screen is different than the others. It is looking for only courses in the   NC  Division and inst ead of counting credit hours as the other calculations have done thus far, this calculation simply counts  the number of NC courses a student is registered in. 14  HOURS BUCKET # 8  Bucket #8   is significantly different than the other Hours Buckets. This particular bucket is designed ONLY to hold the key  to assess a semester Nursing Charge to students. The purpose of moving individual courses to the Hours Table is to  ensure that duplication of   course charges does not happen, as when this charge was previously a course charge. It is  suggested that ALL nursing courses be added to this table. In the first image, note that the Hours Bucket is designed to  look at individual courses. Note on   the Detail screen that this entry is counting Courses, and not credit hours. The only  Charge that references this bucket is NP_SEM. Refer to the charge NP_SEM for additional information.   Note: John E.  Franklin, 02/08/2018   -   The above narrative is outdated. Updated narrative follows.  Hours Bucket 8 functions as a count of Nursing courses being taken during a semester. The count of Nursing courses  from this bucket is now multiplied by $260 to arrive at a total \"per course\" charge for semester. The only charge  definition that reference s this bucket is NP_SEM. The NP_SEM charge takes the count of hours bucket 8 and multiplies  it by $260. This bucket counts the courses not the hours. Students taking 2 courses receive a count of 2. 15  HOURS BUCKET   07_KR_W  Hours Bucket 07_KR_W   was created for one specific purpose   –   to   refund   the registration fee for a very small subgroup  of courses. The Detail tab looks specifically at these individual courses and the Charge Fee KR_W simply looks at this  table. 16 17  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE 25  Fee Code 25   –   Radiology. This fee is a “Course Fee,” meaning that any student registered for the courses listed on the  Detail Tab will be assessed a special charge for taking the course. Note the logic references only individual courses and  NOT the “Hours” Table as   that calculation is not necessary in this particular scenario. 18  The Course Status of “H” and “C” is designed to capture students who drop the course after the census date, but before  Actual charges are run.  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE 30  Fee Code 30   is also a Course Charge. It is an additional fee for any students in Nursing or Radiology. This is designed to  be a one - time fee. However, since Jenzabar does not have a good way to assess a one - time fee to students, this will  remain as a course charge   for first - year students and an exception report will be provided that finds students who have  already paid the fee, but are being assessed the fee a second time. The Detail tab should include all first - year nursing  courses. The logic on the Detail screen   is identical to Fee Code 25. 19 20  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE AA  Fee Code AA   –   Registration Fee  This Fee Code looks simply at Hours Bucket #1. On the Detail Screen, if the student is registered in UG courses, Hours  Bucket #1 will have credits for the student and the “99999” statement is true. Therefore, the $25 Fee will be assessed.  If the student   is not in any credit courses, Hours Bucket #1 will not have credits for the student and the “00001”  statement is true and the fee will not be assessed. This fee is not refundable.   NOTE:   Preliminary charges are not final  charges and if the student drops   all courses prior to Actual charges being run, this fee will be refunded. Therefore it is  imperative to run Actual Charges one or more weeks prior to the first day of the term to make the fee “stick.” 21  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE BB  Fee Code BB   –   Operations Fee. This logic is identical to Fee Code AA. It is refundable up to the Census Date, however. 22 23  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE CC  Fee   Code CC   –   Daytime tuition  Fee   Code CC is a per credit hour charge which assesses a charge based on the location of the student. Entrance Codes  are R   -   Regional, N   –   In State, O   –   Out of State, I   –   International and a blank or “Null” value assumes an In State student.  Each student loc ation is assessed a different tuition charge. 24  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE EE  Fee   Code EE   is an Evening Tuition Hours charge. It is almost identical to Fee code CC, however the EE Fee captures  evening credit hours, not daytime hours. This charge uses the same entrance codes and the same logic as the above  charge. 25  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE FF  Fee Code FF   is a simple per - credit charge for daytime fees. It multiplies the per hour charge on the Detail screen by the  credit hours for the student in Hours Bucket #2. 26  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE HH  Fee Code HH   is also a simple per - credit charge for fees, but for evening fees. The logic is otherwise identical to the  above charge. 27  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE I1  Fee Code   I1   is a Health Insurance charge for the Spring semester ONLY. It is only assessed if the student is in 9 or more  credits.   The credits must fall between the credit range listed on the Detail Screen in order for this charge to  automatically apply. 28  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE II  Fee Code II   –   Fall Insurance Charge is almost identical to I1 Fee Code. The calculation looks for credits in a range  between 8.99 and 99999. Only the fee and semesters differ from the I1 Fee Code. 29  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE J1  Fee   Code   J1   is unique in that it is a   negative charge   applied to a student account. There was no good way to automate  the Refunding process for Health Insurance Waivers, other than with an automated, negative charge. Students who  have 9 or more credits, and have insurance coverage will receive this waiver   if UDEF_5A_2 is populated with the current  Academic Year   (not necessarily the calendar year). This is for the spring term only. 30  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE JJ  Fee   Code   JJ   is also a negative charge for the FALL Health Insurance Waiver. It uses identical logic to the Spring Health  Waiver. This is for only the Fall term. Health Insurance Waivers are good for an entire academic year.   The waiver carries  forward to the Spring   term by virtue of the Biograph_Master.Udef_5A_2 field.  . 31  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE K1  Code   K1   is a charge that will bill a certain fee based on individual courses. This is currently used only by the non - credit  division of RCC. This table must be updated for each course offered each semester. If a course is not listed in the Detail  Tab, a charge   will not be assessed to the student. 32  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE KR  Fee   Code   KR   –   Non - Credit registration fee . This is the only fee that looks at Hours Bucket #6 as this fee is simply  determining if a student is registered in an NC course. If a student has one or more NC courses, the fee is assessed to the  student. If a student is in UG and NC courses, both the   NC and UG Registration Fees are assessed. 33  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE KR_W  Fee   Code   KR_W   is a negative charge that is designed to refund the NC Registration Fee for a very small subset of  courses. The courses are tracked in Hours Bucket #7. This table reads Hours Bucket #7 and if there are courses counted  there for a student, it refunds the   NC Registration Fee. 34  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE LB  Fee   Code   LB   is a charge that is attached to individual courses. Many times there are peripheral costs associated with  offering a course. This fee is simply a way to pass the costs back to the student. Each course must be listed on the detail  screen. In this case,   the course prefix and course number are required, along with the Course Transaction Status of  either “C”   –   Current or “H”   -   History.  All individual courses must be listed on this screen. There is no limit to the number of courses that may be entered on  the Detail screen. It is advantageous to use the copy - and - paste function from Excel to populate a large number of  courses. See the docu ment, “ To Create and Paste Charges from Excel into the Charges Table ” for additional information. 35  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE NP_SEM  Fee Code NP_SEM   is a Charge designed in an unusual way. This is the only charge that references Hours Bucket #8. This  particular hours bucket only   counts the number of Nursing courses   a student is registered in. This charge simply  references Hours Bucket #8 (see the first image below). Note in the second image that if the number of Nursing courses  in Bucket 8 is 1 or more, the charge will be assessed. Since this is a flat fee for an y student registered in any number of  nursing courses, this is the most e fficient way to ensure a single charge is applied to a student account.   Note: John  Franklin 02/08/2018. The above narrative is outdated. Updated narrative follows.  Fee Code NP_SEM   This is the only charge that references Hours Bucket #8. Hours Bucket 8 counts the number of nursing  courses the student is enrolled in. NP_SEM then multiplies the number of courses by $260 to arrive at a total Nursing  Courses Fee for the semester. This   is no longer a flat fee. It equates to a per course charge but it is implemented as a  \"Per Hour Charge\". It has the same effect as charging per course. This was the simplest solution when the business  office advised me that the nursing c ourse fees applied to every course rather than a blanket semester charge of $285 for  nursing students. This new configuration was implemented on 02/08/2018 and thoroughly tested. 36  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE SA  Fee   Code   SA   is a flat fee assessed to any student registered for credit courses. If the student is registered for one or  more   credits, the fee is applied to the student account. 37  CHARGES   -   FEE CODE TF  Fee   Code   TF   -   Technology Fee   is a per - credit fee that is assessed on all UG credits a student is registered for. It looks at  Hours Bucket #1. It multiplies the total number of credits by the per - hour charge listed on the Detail Tab. 38  UNDERSTANDING PRELIMINARY   CHARGES  Preliminary Charges are nothing more than “Estimated” Charges. These charges are used to let students know their  approximate bill, and are also used for the Business Office to make sure all charges are correct before actual billing takes  place. Charges pr oduced through Preliminary Billing (source @C) always have a Suspended Status and can never be  posted. When Actual Charges are run, the @C batch will automatically be deleted. However, it is Best Practice to delete  this @C transaction group prior to runni ng Actual Charges as both charges may occasionally appear to students as they  view their statement online.  Refunds don’t occur while running Preliminary Charges. All Preliminary Charges are wiped out and new charges are put  in place each time Preliminary Charges are re - run. There is no way to test refunds by running Preliminary Charges. In  order to see if yo ur refunds are working correctly, you must run Actual Charges and do all testing in the Play Database.  When reviewing any charge or refund, it is best to view all transactions in the “A/R Inquiry Window.” It is in this window  where you will see a compre hensive list of charges and refunds and their transaction status.  Most RCC charges are created and reliant on the course transaction status (see the image below). Charges in the  “Current” or “History” status will be assessed to a student. Charges that are in “Dropped” status will not be charged to a  student, or they wi ll be refunded to a student if they have already been charged   and   if the charge/refund is prior to the  Census Date.   It is extremely important that staff who add and drop courses on behalf of students understand the  difference between “Dropped” and “Withd raw.” 39  REFUNDS  In order for the Jenzabar system to operate correctly, the Charge generation logic needs to match the Refunds  generation logic. For every Charge that is created, there should be a corresponding Refund   created in the Refund table.  [NOTE: Waiver refunds are the exception to this rule. The system cannot handle refunds for negative charges.  Therefore no refund table entries need to exist for Waiver type charges. ]  Charges that are refundable should have their Refund Percentage set to 1.00000 on the Detail tab. The Jenzabar system  reads this number as 100%. It will read .25000 as 25%, .50000 as 50% and so on.  Refunds will only generate if the   Transaction Status on the course is anything other than C or H, i.e. D for dropped. All  courses dropped after the census date must be handled via the withdraw process. This ensures that the H transaction  status is applied to the course history record.  Following is a sampling of the Refund table entries for select Fee Codes. 40  REFUNDS   -   FEE CODE AA  Refund AA   –   Registration Fee Refund. This fee is intended to be a non - refundable Registration fee. Once a student  registers for courses, this fee is intended to “stick” and not be refunded. However, this happens ONLY when Actual  charges are run. Preliminary Charge s are simply estimated charges and will be automatically deleted when Actual  charges are run. It is therefore advisable to run Actual charges no later than the Census date in order to capture these  student registrations.   This particular Charge i s looking at only Hours Bucket #1 to determine if a student is registered in  courses for a particular year and term. 41  REFUNDS   -   FEE CODE I1  Refund Code I1   is a Health Insurance Charge for the Spring Semester. This Refund looks at a numerical credit range for  the total number of UG credits a student is enrolled in. When credits fall at 8.99 or fewer, a refund will generate (see  the second image below). 42  REFUNDS   -   FEE CODE CC  Refund Code CC   will refund Daytime Tuition based on the number of credits a student is enrolled in. The corresponding  charge is a per - hour charge. This calculation looks at the Entrance Code and Hours Bucket #2 to determine enrolled  credits and the per credit hour charg e.",
