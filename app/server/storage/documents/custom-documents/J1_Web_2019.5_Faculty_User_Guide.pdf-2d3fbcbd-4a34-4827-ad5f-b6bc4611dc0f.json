Any of these might prevent you from seeing courses from some time periods:  •   the selected filter  •   the definition of active courses  •   the registrar's restriction of past and future years available for searches  First, remove filters that might prevent you from seeing courses from past and future years.  •   On the Course Center and My Course Center blocks, select a less restrictive filter. J1 Web Registration 2019.5 – Faculty User Guide   7  You can create and save filters on the Course List and My Course List page.  Create a filter with no selections, and call it All Courses.  •   On the Course List and My Course List pages, click   Clear all   and   Apply   to remove any filters.  •   If removing filters doesn't give you all the past and future courses you need, ask the registrar's office whether any restrictions in the Registration Administration hub are preventing you from seeing past and future years.  o   The registrar defines active courses, setting the number of days before a course begins and after it ends that it's considered active.  o   The registrar can also restrict the number of past and future academic years available.  Why is some information out of date?  Caching may prevent some information from updating. An iisreset on each J1 Web webserver will clear its cache and update the information.  Here's the technical information for your IT department:  The following data is cached on the J1 Web webserver so that J1 Web can perform better. These items do not change very often in the J1 Database, so we can cache the data on the J1 Web webserver. However, if the data does change, then an iisreset is needed. If you're load balancing, you need an iisreset on each J1 Web webserver.  •   Allow Waitlisting setting in the Configuration Table in J1 Desktop \"OVERENROLL\" setting  •   Course Title Format in Configuration Table \"CRSTITLETODISP\"  •   Credit Labels in Division Def table.  •   Grade Table values in GRADE_TABLE  •   RE departments  •   Locations J1 Web Registration 2019.5 – Faculty User Guide   8  •   Years and Terms (This one has a 5-minute timeout, so when you add terms, they should show up in J1 Web within 5 minutes.)  •   Override (Authorization) Reason  •   Divisions  •   License information  The following are settings in J1 Web.

The parent and child courses may have different grading periods assigned. You can only enter or edit grades during a grading period.  I entered grades. Why can't I edit them?  There are separate permissions for those tasks:  •   Can view and enter grades for ungraded courses  •   Can view and update grades for graded courses  Why Can't I enter a Last Date of Attendance?  Some grades (such as withdrawal grades) may require a Last Date of Attendance, but only for final grading periods. If you can't enter a Last Date of Attendance, then either the grade doesn't require it or it's not the final grading period.  Why can't I enter grades in a roll-up section?  This applies only to schools using Competency Based Education.  For roll-up sections, you grade the competencies. The section grade is calculated from the competency grades. See \"How to Enter Grades for Competencies\" above.
