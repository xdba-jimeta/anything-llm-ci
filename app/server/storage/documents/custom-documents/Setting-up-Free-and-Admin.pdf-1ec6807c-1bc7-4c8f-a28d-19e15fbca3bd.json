DEFINITIONS  *FREE functionality allows you to capture courses that exist i n a student’s   course history that do not apply to specific program requirements within his/her general education, major, concentration, certification/certificate, or minor, but which can be used to fulfill the hours required for graduation. Typically these courses make up the general   or “free”   elective component of an undergraduate degree program.  #ADMN functionality allows you to keep courses from falling into the *FREE bucket that do n’t apply  towards graduation according to your institutional policies. This can include forgiven courses, withdrawn courses, remedial courses, activity courses, or courses taken within a certain division, such as Continuing Education or Workforce Development, etc.  CODING  Before you work through the steps on the following pages, determine how you would like to refer to your *FREE and #ADM N aims “publicly,” that is, when   communicating with your advisors and students. The coding convention and descriptions you use should be intuitive for the EX users working to define and maintain the codes, allowing them to easily interpret Jenzabar technical documentation and effectively interact with Jenzabar Services and Support, but should also clearly communicate to students and advisors what the requirements represent.  Both the *FREE and #ADMN aims will consist of an Aim Label, a Root ARC, and the *FREE or #ADMN ARC, respectively. We recommend you use a code of *FREE and #ADMN for the two ARCs that provide the functionality described above, however you can come up with your own coding convention for the Aim Labels and Root ARCs.  There are several coding conventions that are considered a best practice for the *FREE Aim Label and Root ARCs:     Coding the Aim Label as FREE and each Root ARC as FREE## where the ## represents the  number of credit hours or units required: FREE03, FREE06, FREE12, FREE24...     Coding the Aim Label as ELECT and each Root ARC as ELECTS## where the ## represents the  number of credit hours or units required: ELECTS09, ELECTS21, ELECTS36...     Coding the Aim Label as FREE or ELECT but each Root ARC to match its corresponding program: if your major trees are coded BUSBS, ENGB A, CRJBS, SOWBS... then your corresponding elective  trees would be coded BUSBSELE, ENGBAELE, CRJBSELE, and SOWBSELE ...  The benefit of using either of the first two options is that regardless of how many majors you offer that require some number of general elective hours to graduate, you only have to define one Root ARC per total; in other words, if you offer four majors that all require 15 hours of electives, you only have to define   one   Root ARC that represents that minimum number (FREE15 or ELECTS15, for example). December 2015 2 Page  The benefit of using the third option is that it allows you to make adjustments to the hours needed column at will, without contradicting the code or description and causing confusion for advisors and students. A manual alteration is required anytime you need to increase/decrease the number of hours needed to fulfill a requirement.  EXAMPLE  For example, a student enrolls in your B.A. in English program which requires the following:  60 Credit Hours in General Education requirements  36 Credit Hours in Major requirements  120 Credit Hours to graduate  If the student fulfills the requirements for the General Education and Major components of the program with the minimum number of credit hours indicated, she will need at least 24 credit hours of general electives in order to earn the 120 minimum credit hours to graduate. As a result, you will need to define a Root ARC that will be used to create the *FREE aim for this program: FREE24, ELECTS24, or ENGBAELE, using the coding examples identified on the previous page.  If the student transfers in from an institution where the courses are worth 1 credit hour more than the equivalent courses at your institution, and fulfills half of her General Education requirements (10 courses) through transfer courses worth an extra credit hour each, assuming she completes the remaining 10 courses at your institution for 3 credit hours each, she will have earned 10 hours more than she needs to fulfill the minimum hours for General Education. This means she will earn the 120 minimum credit hours required to graduate with 10 fewer general elective credit hours than a student who began the program as a first-time freshman at your institution. As a result, you will need to edit her general elective aim to reduce the hours needed from 24.00 down to 14.00.  Depending on the coding convention you choose for your Root ARCs, you can handle the adjustment in one of two ways:     If you define the Root ARCs using the non-major-specific coding convention FREE24 or ELECTS24, you will need to manually delete the aim from the student and manually add a FREE14 or ELECTS14 aim so that the code, description, and hours needed value all communicate the requirement the same way. The downside to this method is that if the student changes majors, the   automatic trigger responsible for reassigning the student’s aims will leave any aims  that were added manually, meaning that the user who makes the major change will need to evaluate the list of aims that appear on the Advising tab of the   Student Information   window and potentially go and delete one or more (students should not have more than one elective aim). Additionally, since the denominations of elective credit hours required can vary from student to student, you may need to define additional Root ARCs and build additional elective trees on an ongoing basis, as needed.     If you define the Root ARCs using the major-specific coding convention ENGBAELE, you will use a manual alteration to reduce the hours needed value on the aim from 24 to 14. The alteration will remain intact as long as the student is assigned to this aim. If the student changes majors, this aim will be automatically deleted and a new elective aim will be added. The downside to  this method is that if the alteration holds true after she’s chan ged majors, you will need to re- enter it on the newly assigned elective aim. Additionally this method requires you to define a December 2015 3 Page  Root ARC for each major that requires elective hours, even when/if there are majors that require the same number of elective hours.  Some codes and (descriptions) to consider for your #ADMN Aim Label and Root ARC include:     NONAP (Non-Applied Coursework)     NACW (Non-Applied Coursework)     ADMIN (Administrative Catch-All)     UNUSED (Unused Courses)     EXCLUDED (Excluded Coursework)  Regardless of which coding method you decide to use, it is important to be consistent and to use wording that is clear and intuitive to EX users as well as advisors and students.  SETUP  There are six steps to setting up *FREE and #ADMN in your database:     Define these two ARC types in the   Maintain Advising Requirement Types   window     Define the *FREE and #ADMN ARCs in the   Maintain Advising Requirements   window     Define the Root ARCs for each in the   Maintain Advising Requirements   window     Build *FREE and #ADMN trees in the   Institutional Requirement Trees   window     Add the two trees as aims for each major in the   Degree/Aim Cross-Reference   window     Run the   Synchronize Advisee Information   process to mass-assign these two aims to students  I.   DEFINE *FREE AND #ADMN ARC TYPES  a.   Open the   Maintain Advising Requirement Types   window  b.   Use the right-click   Add Row   option to add two rows; type the recommended *FREE and #ADMN codes, along with descriptions you feel clearly communicate what these two ARC types are used for, both for internal EX users and for your advisors and students  c.   Fill in the remaining columns ( Cluster ,   Print Order ,   Comment ) with the recommended default settings displayed in the screenshot above  d.   Save and close this window December 2015 4 Page  II.   DEFINE *FREE AND #ADMN AIM LABELS  a.   Open the   Maintain Aim Labels   window  b.   Use the right-click   Add Row   option to add two rows: type the codes (up to 5 characters) according to the convention you have decided to use; use the same description you typed in the previous step (for consistency)  c.   Select Program as the   Aim Category   for your *FREE aim label, and Other for your #ADMN aim label  d.   Set the   Print Order   based on how you’d like these aims to sort, relative to the other aims  assigned to a student  e.   Save and close this window  III.   DEFINE *FREE AND #ADMN ARCS  a.   Open the   Maintain Advising Requirements   window  b.   Use the right-click   Add Row   option to add two rows; type the *FREE and #ADMN codes, along  with the same descriptions you’ve used in the previ ous two steps (for consistency)  c.   Set the   Type   to match the   Requirement   code (*FREE for *FREE and #ADMN for #ADMN); by default, both rows will receive a value of Group in the   Cluster   column  d.   Set the   Relation   value to OR  e.   Populate a   Begin Date   to record when you defined these two new codes  f.   Deselect the   Reuse   checkbox as this setting does not apply to ARCs with a value of Group or Root in the   Cluster   column  g.   Save December 2015 5 Page  IV.   DEFINE ROOT ARCS  a.   In the   Maintain Advising Requirements   window, use the right-click   Add Row   option to add a row for each Root ARC you will need to define according to the convention you have decided to use. You will need multiple Root ARCs for your *FREE aim (either coded based on denominations of hours, or based on program) and one Root ARC for your #ADMN aim; use the same/similar descriptions as you typed in the previous step (for consistency)  b.   Set the   Type   to Root, which will automatically default the   Cluster   column to Root and the  Relation   column to AND  c.   On each of your *FREE Root ARCs, if applicable, set a default value in the   Hours Needed   column; do not set a value in this column for your #ADMN Root ARC as no hours are required for this aim, it is simply a catch-all for unused/non-applicable coursework  d.   Populate a   Begin Date   to record when you defined these new codes  e.   Deselect the   Reuse   checkbox as this setting does not apply to ARCs with a value of Group or Root in the   Cluster   column  f.   Save and close this window December 2015 6 Page  V.   BUILD THE TREES  a.   Open the   Institutional Requirement Trees   window, type in the   Year   in which you plan to build your *FREE and #ADMN trees, and click the   Find Now   button to load all the trees which exist in that year  *Tip: You will need to copy these trees into every year to which current students are tied, so either start with the oldest year and copy forward, or start with the most recent year and copy backward. Do not start in the middle or you may inadvertently miss one or more years.  b.   In the   Available Requirements   section in the bottom right hand corner of the window, type your #ADMN Root ARC in the   Requirement   column and click the   Find Now   button December 2015 7 Page  c.   Drag the Root ARC into the catalog year by left-clicking on it in the bottom right hand corner of the window, dragging it over to the white left hand section of the window, highlighting the world icon at the top (where it says   Institutional Requirement Trees ) and letting go of your mouse. When you let go, it should appear at the bottom of the list of trees  d.   Next search for the #ADMN ARC in the bottom right hand corner, and drag it into the Root ARC you dragged in the previous step   (by ensuring it’s highlighted b efore you let go of your mouse)  e.   Click the plus sign next to the Root ARC to expand and verify that the #ADMN ARC exists beneath it December 2015 8 Page  f.   Repeat step B on the previous page for each of your *FREE Root ARCs, dragging and dropping each into the catalog year, one at a time; in the screenshot below, only ELECTS03, ELECTS06, and ELECTS07 have been added to the 2009 catalog year, so the remaining ELECTS## Root ARCs shown in the bottom right hand corner still need to be dragged and dropped  g.   Repeat step C for your *FREE ARC, dragging and dropping it into each of your *FREE Root ARCs, one at a time. Click the plus sign next to each *FREE Root ARC to ensure the *FREE ARC exists beneath it December 2015 9 Page  h.   Finally, work through each *FREE tree, setting the   Hours Needed   value on the *FREE ARC so that it matches the value on the *FREE Root ARC above it, saving after you complete each one  *Tip: If the Hours Needed value is not divisible by your most common course credit hour denomination, set the Maximum Hours value to the next divisible number and check the When Met, Load Courses Until Max checkbox. For example, if you have a program that requires 7 credit hours of general electives, but the majority of your courses are offered for 3 credit hours each, set the Hours Needed value to 7.00 and the Maximum Hours value to 9.00 so that a student who has earned 6 hours and needs to take an additional course to get to 7 will not be prohibited from taking a 3 hour course to fulfill the requirement. December 2015 10 Page  VI.   ADD THE AIMS  a.   Open the   Degree/Aim Cross Reference   window  b.   Click on the row for which you need to add the *FREE and #ADMN aims in the   Master   section of the window (top half, beneath the yellow bar)  c.   In the   Detail   section of the window (bottom half) use the right-click   Add Row   option to add a row for the #ADMN aim  d.   From the   Aim   drop-down, type/select the Aim Label you defined for the #ADMN aim. Use the TAB key on your keyboard to tab to the   Requirement   column  e.   From the   Requirement   drop-down, type/select the #ADMN Root ARC you defined for the #ADMN aim  f.   Save  g.   Repeat steps C-F for the applicable *FREE aim  h.   Repeat steps B-G for each major in each catalog year for which you need to assign the *FREE and #ADMN aims December 2015 11 Page  VII.   SYNCHRONIZE STUDENTS  Perform this step when you are ready to mass-assign aims to students.  a.   Open the   Synchronize Advisee Information   window  *Tip: The default <Original> query pulls students enrolled in the current year and term as defined in the  Registration Configuration   window. If this is the correct group of students to whom you need to assign the *FREE and #ADMN aims, continue with the following steps. If you need to modify the query to pull a different population based on additional criteria, skip to step VIII in this document to learn how to modify the query and then return to this step to select your custom query and complete the remaining steps in the synchronization process.  b.   Click on the   Options   tab to select the   Synchronize Aims with Degree History   checkbox and then click   OK   to run the process; a pop-up message will notify you when the process is complete December 2015 12 Page  VIII.   CUSTOMIZE THE SYNCHRONIZE ADVISEE INFORMATION QUERY  Perform this step only if the group of students you need to assign the *FREE and #ADMN aims to is different than the default selection of all students enrolled in the current year and term as defined in the   Registration Configuration   window.  a.   Click the   Customize   button to launch InfoMaker; click   OK   to the   Confirm Overwrite   pop-up message that appears  c.   Log into InfoMaker and immediately navigate to   File > Save As   to make a copy of the original query December 2015 13 Page  d.   Save the query by appending the name to reflect the population of students that the query will pull; add text to the   Comments   box to further describe who customized the query, when, and what the query is pulling in plain English and click   OK  e.   In the middle menu bar, click the   icon to open the   Data Source   side of the query December 2015 14 Page  f.   To narrow the list of currently enrolled students to just those who fall under the 2015 catalog (following the example used on the previous pages), an additional table must be added to the query — the Degree History table. Use a right-click in the white space to   Select Tables  g.   Type or scroll through and select degree_history and click the   Open   button December 2015 15 Page  h.   By default, InfoMaker attempts to join the table to one/more tables already present in the query. Click the box with the equal sign to open the Join dialog box, then click the   Delete   button to remove the join  i.   To create the correct join, click the   icon in the menu bar December 2015 16 Page  j.   Click the id_num column in the name_master box and then the id_num column in the degree_history box to join the two tables on the ID; in the screenshot below, two joins are displayed — the original join between the name_master and student_term_sum tables that were part of the default query, and the join between the name_master and degree_history table that you just added (blue highlighted columns in the boxes displayed below)  k.   Turn off the join tool by clicking the   icon once again  l.   Verify that you created the joins correctly by clicking on the   Syntax   tab at the very bottom of your screen; joins in InfoMaker are written within the WHERE clause with the tables and columns within a set of parentheses with an equals sign between them; the line circled in the screenshot below reflects the join added in the screenshot above December 2015 17 Page  m.   Click on the   Where   tab to add two lines of syntax to the query to ensure it pulls only those students who are tied to the 2015 catalog year; in the screenshot below, the bottom two lines specify that if the student has a row in the Degree History table where the   Current   checkbox is checked, which has an   Advising Institutional Requirement Year   of 2015, s/he will be selected by the query  n.   Verify the results of your query by clicking the   icon in the toolbar. The resulting IDs will load, along with a Row Count in the bottom center of the window.  o.   Click the   icon to close the preview and return to the query; if the results of the preview were not correct, make adjustments to your syntax and/or table selection, repeating step N until you are satisfied with the results.  p.   Click the   icon to return to the report side of the query  q.   Click   Ok   to the pop-up message that is alerting you to the fact that the results of your report may have changed and that your preview may need to be refreshed  r.   Save your customized query using the   icon  s.   Close InfoMaker and return to EX  t.   Close the   Synchronize Advisee Information   window and re-open it to refresh the   Query   drop- down so that you can select your customized query.  u.   Return to Step VII on page 5 to complete the Synchronize Advisee Information process following steps B and C.",
