User Contact Profile information is required for the communication and notification features of Jenzabar to function. There are several modules that rely heavily on Contact Profile information to ensure that notifications are deliverable to users. The Budget Module, and Purchasing/Requisition modules are both good examples.  Every Jenzabar user must setup their own Contact Profile information. If it is not setup correctly, the user will receive no notifications.  PRECONDITIONS  The user must have a Jenzabar account.  The user must know the user name and password for their account.  The user must have the Jenzabar client application open.
