Trinity Allen  Academic Advising Systems Coordinator  Berry College  Dynamic Graduation Audits  Jenzabar’s Annual Meeting  May 27 - 30, 2015 Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center  Nashville, TN  Bryce Durbin  Registrar / IR Director  Berry College © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  About Berry     ~2000 Students     40 Undergrad majors  •   10 graduate programs in Business & Education     3 Degree conferral dates & 1 graduation ceremony     ~400 graduates per year  •   10 Summer, 90 Fall, 300 Spring     1 Academic Advising Systems Coordinator © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  The Goal     Develop a Graduation Audit that:  •   Updates as changes are made  •   Is easy for students and advisors to read  •   Is effective  •   Eliminates last minute emergencies & surprises  •   Documents communications with students  •   Reduces workload on Registrar’s office staff © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Staff reviews all student Advising Worksheets.  •   This involved a lot of manual editing     Set graduation stage to record audit date, status, and notes.     Deficient areas hand typed into a form letter and sent to student and advisor.     Students made changes and came in for reviews  •   But with 5 different people working on different aspects at the same time, how do we keep up?     All audits reassessed midway through fall semester, again after grades processed, after registration in spring, throughout spring until graduation.  The Old Process © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Advisors and students loved the easy to read “heads up” early in the process.     More students made changes early on.     Reduced number of last minute surprises for students and Registrar’s Office.  What Worked © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Too labor intensive.     Feedback to students and advisors slow at best after changes were made.     Re-auditing everyone at several points was burdensome.     Hard to document communications and changes.  What Didn’t Work © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Speed up initial audit process     Develop a system to record audit changes     Find a way to update audits in a timely manner  Room for Improvement © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Fixed Advising Trees  •   see 2014 JAM Presentation 239 “Now Hiring: Interpretive Arborist”     Eliminated individualized audit letters  •   To be brought back in a more automated version     Audits held to be mass emailed  •   Students & advisors receive emails immediately prior to add/drop     Time for all audits reduced to 1 person over 3 weeks  Reducing Initial Audit Time © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     Set stage data and comments  Tracking Changes © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.  •   Custom InfoMaker Report  •   Pulls basic information from Advising Worksheet  •   Pulls Graduation Stage Comments  •   Reviews universal graduation requirements  Disseminating Information © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.
