It is probable that the custom solutions could be  redesigned in order to avoid this trouble, but at this time the effort required outweighs the benefit.  Preconditions  The Jenzabar upgrade must have been applied.  OFF THE SHELF TRIGGER CUSTOMIZATI ON  Overview  The testing and placement stored procedures were originally written to DELETE then re - INSERT records  into the Student Course History table. With each INSERT and DELETE   off the shelf   triggers   flag the  student’s record for Academic Recalculati on. Since the Placement scripts run every 15 minutes, those  students who have taken placement tests also have their Student Course History records updated every  15 minutes. This essentially results in an infinite loop of Academic Record recalculation   for   every  student who has ever taken a placement exam.  Ideally, the logic for the placement would be re - written to avoid the infinite DELETEs and INSERTS.  However the SQL code is exceedingly complex and would require substantial investment to rewrite.  Ther efore, it is   less expensive to RCC to maintain the off - the - shelf triggers instead.  Two triggers must be modified:   TR_DEL_STUDENT_CRS_HIST   and   TI_STUDENT_CRS_HIST  1.   Locate the trigger source code   for   TI_STUDENT_CRS_HIST . The triggers are on the  Student_Co urse_Hist table.  2.   Open the trigger source code from SQL Server Management Studio using the “Script Trigger As |  ALTER To | New Query Window” menu item. See Figure 1 Figure 1  3.   Locate the portion of the code   where the   Student_Master.run_academic_recalc field is being set to  the value 1. See Figure 2.  Figure 2  4.   The highlighted code is the code that needs to be added. By adding this to the WHERE clause, it  prevents the placement records from triggering   academic recalculation:  and i.trm_cde <> ‘PL’  5.   Run the Alter command by executing the query.  6.   Locate the trigger source code for   TR_DEL_STUDENT_CRS_HIST . The triggers are on the  Student_Course_Hist table.  7.   Open the trigger source code from SQL Server Managem ent Studio using the “Script Trigger As |  ALTER To | New Query Window” menu item. Same as in Figure 1.  8.   Locate the portion of the code where the Student_Master.run_academic_recalc field is being set to  the value 1. See Figure 3. Figure 3  9.   The highlight ed code is the code that needs to be added. By adding this to the WHERE clause, it  prevents the placement records from triggering academic recalculation:  and   d .trm_cde <> ‘PL’  10.   Run the Alter command by executing the query. DYNAMIC DATA MA SKING  Overview  Dynamic Data Masking   (DDM)   was   first   implemented   at RCC   on 10/22/2020. DDM   provides a certain  measure of data security that is lacking when an organization decides to allow back - door acce ss to the  enterprise database. Due to   RCC ’ s widesp read use of Mic roso ft Access   with   Linked Ta bles , and the  gaping security hole th at is opene d up by this practice ,   RCC decided to implement the recommendation  provided by CampusWorks I nc. to apply   D DM to the Jenzabar and PowerFAIDS databases.  Per Jenzabar ’s feedback on this subject, DDM is effective in these situations.   Jen z abar   also point ed out  th at the DDM would need to be reapplied after every up grade. These work instructions cover   that  process .  Work Instructions  The database administrator, or one with sys admin role will need to run a script that applies the DDM to  the two databases. The script is named,   “ JEF_Apply_Dynamic_Data_Masking.sql ”   and is located in the  “ S: \\ RCC Work Instructions \\ IT ”   network folder.  1.   Open SQL Server   Management Studio.  2.   Open the   .s ql script file   in a SQL editor window .  3.   Review the UNMASK section an d validate that the UNMASK privileges are being granted to  appropriate personnel. Likely,   staff   turnover will have obligated   us to modify   the UNMA SK  directives, so make any appropriate changes and save the   .s ql file.  4.   Execute the script from the SSMS editor window.  5.   Review the results to   ensure the script was successful.  END OF WORK   INSTRUCTIONS",
