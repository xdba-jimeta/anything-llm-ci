This course will review the features and functions of the Purchasing module. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  7  Chapter 3.   P URCHASING   O VERVIEW  This chapter will introduce an overview of the features and functions that are available in the EX Purchasing module.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand different types of purchasing models     Recognize the workflow within the EX Purchasing module and the types of individuals that may be responsible for performing individual processes and activities     Assign the appropriate permissions to the Tasklist security groups (also referred to as roles) identified at your institution  C ENTRALIZED VS .   D ECENTRALIZED   M ODELS  Purchasing methods and structures to support your overall business strategies are critical components for operational efficiency and effectiveness. Consider the types of theories that are available and determine the best technique that will be compatible with your specific situation.  You can choose to utilize a centralized, decentralized, or a hybrid purchasing model depending on the policy or preference that has been established at your school. Research has found that the choice tends to be related to the size of your budget.  Centr alization  The main purpose of centralized purchasing is to save money and promote standardization for accepted business principles.  When using centralized purchasing, all purchases are managed through a purchasing department with certain tasks performed by specific individuals. In this case, you may identify one person to create a requisition, another person to approve the requisition, and another person to convert the requisition to a purchase order.  The following list identifies some of the benefits and disadvantages of a centralized model:     Organized planning for common items across various departments     Established standards for materials, supplies and equipment     Budgetary and financial control of expenditures     Greater utilization of materials through transfers and substitutions     Managed delivery and service through focused and organized follow up systems     Established relationships between purchasing and vendors  By using a centralized model, you can define a single purchasing scheme that creates a controlled environment. Your purchasing department can be responsible for bids, verify compliance with your school's standards, and ensure bulk discounts and other economies of scale. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   8  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Decentralization  When using decentralized purchasing, several individuals throughout your school may be granted purchasing authority. You may choose to allow any employee to make their own purchases or grant purchasing authority to specific managers. In this case, one person can be both the requestor and the purchasing agent.  The following list identifies some of the benefits and disadvantages of a decentralized model:     Eliminates the need for purchasing FTEs     Utilize and support local vendors/flexibility in selecting vendors     More cost control when local operation is established as a profit center     Duplicate efforts in purchasing with less buyer specialization     Less controlled environment     Unable to benefit from quantity discounts     Lose shipping options based on quantity or weight  By providing each department with its own purchasing authority, you can be more responsive to time- sensitive needs. However, you may lose the benefits of sealed-bid contracts and ad-hoc buying practices can prevent the benefits of long-term pricing agreements.  You can also use the hybrid approach where the major purchases utilize a centralized method and other items (below a certain amount) are handled through decentralization.  Once you have established a fully centralized purchasing system, it is difficult to switch to a decentralized system since employees will experience a loss of control. You will need to examine your specific needs in order to determine the best methodology for your school. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  9  R EVIEWING THE   W ORKFLOW  The Purchasing module consists of functionality that will assist you in:     Identifying goods or services that need to be ordered     Requesting the goods or services  o   Essentially, this is the first step performed within the purchasing system     Facilitating communication to approve or deny the requests  o   Depending on the policy that has been established at your school, all expenditures will need to be approved before proceeding any further  o   The person approving the requisition will need to be able to verify that the requisition will be assigned to the appropriate general ledger account number and that the amount will not exceed the designated budget     Converting approved requests into purchase orders  o   After the requisition is approved, an actual purchase order can be created     Contacting the vendor to place the order     Receiving the goods  o   Indicate that the purchase order has been completed and that the goods have actually been received and accepted  The illustration below provides a visual representation of the tasks that might be performed by each individual within a centralized purchasing environment: EX Purchasing Learning Guide   10  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  C ONTACT   P ROFILES AND   P REFERENCES  Throughout the Purchasing module, you will find specific windows displaying a person's name along with an icon   that represents contact profile information.  Jenzabar highly recommends that any person working within the Purchasing module create a contact profile so that the proper notifications and information can be communicated.  For example, the screen capture below shows the   Approve Requisitions   window which includes the names of those individuals who have the ability to approve requisitions. Notice that when you place your cursor on the icon, a message is displayed indicating that you can view the contact profile for this person by clicking the icon:  In this case, when you click the contact profile icon for Chris O’Brian, another window will be displayed showing information about Chris: EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  11  Each individual user can determine the amount of information that is displayed on this window by establishing a profile.  1   From Jenzabar EX, go to   Tools   User Preferences  The options that you select on the   User Preferences   window will be applied to all EX modules. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   12  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  2   Click the   Set My Profile Preferences   link to select the information that will be displayed on the contact profile mentioned above  The information on the left side of this window is data that the school has on file for you in the Name Master. While you may choose any of these data elements to display in your contact profile on the right side of the window, you may also choose to change and display different information in the Purchasing module.  If you make any changes to your contact profile, the changes will NOT be updated or reflected in the information that the school has on file for you.  3   You may also click the   Browse   button to locate a picture you would like to upload and display with your contact information  4   After you have identified your contact information, click the   View My Shared Profile   link to see your profile as displayed to other users  The options that you select on the   Contact Profile   window will only be displayed in the EX Purchasing module.  5   You can choose to share your position, mobile phone, campus phone, or campus address on your profile – your name and email will always be displayed EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  13  Chapter 4.   G ENERAL   S ETTINGS  This chapter will explain the setup that is required to configure the Purchasing module to fit your specific needs.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Establish a robust notification process     Identify the types of files that can be attached to a requisition     Create default requisition entry windows for one or more groups     Associate different general ledger allocation codes to a single line item  P URCHASING   S ETUP  In order to set up the Purchasing module – and have permissions to access the   Purchasing Module Setup   window – you will need to be granted the appropriate security through Tasklist.  Currently, POManager is one of four default groups included with the Purchasing module, which has already been identified with the function security to perform setup steps within Purchasing.  You may change the permissions that have been granted to an existing group or create your own group that will have access to all of the administrative Purchasing functions.  1   In the Tasklist module, go to the   Group Definition   window  o   Locate the POManager group  2   Click the   Membership   button and be sure that the proper individuals are members of the POManager group  3   Click the   Permissions   button and the   Functions tab EX Purchasing Learning Guide   14  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  4   When the Purchasing Module Setup function is selected as highlighted in the screen capture above, the   Purchasing Module Setup   window will become enabled  The   Purchasing Module Setup   window can be used to perform administrative tasks such as:     Creating notifications that can be sent to one or more groups/roles     Selecting inventory preferences     Defining shipping address, terms and locations     Choosing requisition entry defaults     Building and assigning approval tracks     Identifying the types of files that can be attached to a requisition or purchase order     Indicating the module manager's email address that appears on the bottom of every activity center to facilitate communications     Establishing general ledger account allocations     Determining disbursement cycle rules  The selections that are made on the Purchasing Module Setup window will affect the behavior of all Purchasing functions; therefore, assign these permissions with careful consideration. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  15  N OTIFICATIONS  One of the most dynamic features of the Purchasing module is being able to inform others when a specific task or step has been performed. By using the notification process, you can keep the appropriate personnel informed of the current status for each requisition and keep the purchasing process operating efficiently as illustrated in the diagram below:  Notifications are sent in the form of an email and you can create your own template that will be used for any notification.  You will need to perform three steps to utilize the notification feature:  1   Identify the event that will precipitate a notification  o   Such as Create requisition, Requisition approved, and Requisition denied shown in the diagram above  2   Select the person(s) to be notified when the event occurs  o   Such as approver, requester, and purchasing agent shown in the diagram above  3   Create the email template that will be used for the notification EX Purchasing Learning Guide   16  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Step 1:   Identify the event  To establish your notification process, go to the   Purchasing Module Setup   window.  All notifications are identified in the   Set Notification Preferences   section on the General tab of the  Purchasing Module Setup   window:     Requisition notifications can be set on the   Create Requisitions t ab     Approval notifications can be set on the   Approvals tab     Purchase order notifications can be set on the   Create PO tab     All of the above as well as other event notifications can be set on the   General tab  For the purpose of illustration, we will use the   General tab .  1   From the options available in the drop down menu, choose the event that will cause the notification to be sentIdent  You must select an event to enable the remaining options in the Set Notification Preferences section.  2   To activate an automatic notification that will be sent when the chosen event occurs, select the checkbox.  o   Even if you do not utilize automatic notification, you can choose to send an individual email to the requester, purchasing agent, or vendor directly through the actual requisition; however, this will be a manual process. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  17  Step 2:   Select persons to be notified  The next step in the notification process is to identify the person(s) to be notified when the event occurs.  From the   Setup Notification   window appears, go to the Who Get Notified tab to select the roles that will be notified when the event occurs.  In a previous section, the direct correlation between Roles and Activity Centers were explained – that is, depending on the group/role to which you belong, the appropriate activity centers will be displayed on your workspace.  The 'roles' that are selected for notification purposes in this step are actually not referring to the same groups/roles that are used for activity centers. In this case, the 'roles' refer to those individuals who have been identified directly on the requisition and who may or may not belong to the same groups/roles used for activity centers.  The illustration below shows a requisition and the individuals who have been identified as a requester, approver (click on the link to see a list of names defined for the approval track), and the purchasing agent:  The names for the requester and purchasing agent above are actually hyperlinks that you can click to create a dynamic email. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   18  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Email Addresses  In order for the notification process to function properly, you must have a valid email address to which the notifications can be sent. Your email can be accessed from two sources:     Contact Profile     Purchasing Module  o   Address Master  •   Name Entity ( Address tab )  •   Maintain Address  In Purchasing, go to   T ools     User Preferences and click the Set My Profile Preferences link at the bottom of the window  Jenzabar highly recommends that any person working within the Purchasing module create a contact profile so that the proper notifications and information can be communicated.  An email address can also be identified on the   General   tab of the   Purchasing Module Setup   window as illustrated below: EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  19  If you do not create a contact profile, the system has another way to retrieve your email address depending on whether the proper setting has been selected.  In the Common module, go to the   Name Entity   window ( Address tab )  If you have an email address in this record AND the   Notification Enabled   checkbox is selected, the system will send notifications to this email.  When using the notification feature, the contact profile information will always override the email in the Address Master. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   20  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Step 3:   Create the email template  You can actually build your own email template and identify the data elements that will be merged into the text to personalize each notification that is associated with a specific event. When the   Setup Notification  window appears, you can define the subject and text that will appear in each of your notifications.  Click the   icon on the   Build Notification Template   window to insert placeholders within the subject or message text that will insert the appropriate data when the email is sent.  This process is very similar to a merge document where fields are identified within the body of the document.  Always use @@ before and after the data component as illustrated above. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  21  Viewing Notifications  In order to view your notifications, you can look at the bottom of your workspace to see if you have any notifications that need to be viewed (notice the icon displayed in the screen capture below):  1   At any time, you  can also go to   Tools   View Notifications EX Purchasing Learning Guide   22  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  A window listing all of your current notifications will be displayed – both those that have already been viewed as well as those that have not yet been viewed.  2   After a notification has been viewed, you may choose to delete it by clicking the button in the bottom right of the window  M ODULE   S PECIFIC   S ETTINGS  You can use the five tabs on the Purchasing Module Setup window to identify the settings that will be applied within the module.  In addition to notification preferences, you can also define the types of files that can be attached in various locations and the email address for the module manager on the General tab of the Purchasing Module Setup window.  1   Click   Make file extensions available for attachment EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  23  2   Select the types of files that can be attached within the Purchasing module by clicking on the   Make Available   checkbox next to each file type  3   To add a different file, click   Create a new file extension , select the   Add Row   right-click option, and enter the extension and description for the new file type  Requisition Entry Defaults  You can associate a specific group in  the Purchasing module with a default requisition entry window that will be displayed with pre-populated fields.  This will impact the manner in which requisitions are created – that is, when a user belongs to a specific group, the defaults that have been selected will automatically appear on the   Requisition Entry   window.  Click the Set requisition entry defaults and security link on the Create Requisitions tab of the   Purchasing Module Setup   window.  1   Right-click and choose the   Add Row   option EX Purchasing Learning Guide   24  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  2   Choose a group ID and its associated characteristics  When a group member logs into the EX system, the defaults that have been identified for the respective group will determine the information displayed on the   Requisition Entry   window.  Requisition and Purchase Order Numbers  If you are using pre-printed forms and want to be sure that the number on the form matches the requisition or purchase order number, you can do so.  Click the Set initial or change next requisition number link on the Create Requisitions tab of the   Purchasing Module Setup   window  You may also click the Set initial or change next PO number link on the Create PO tab of the   Purchasing Module Setup   window  The requisition number is automatically assigned when the requisition is created.  Using the appropriate source code, identify the number that will appear on the next requisition or purchase order EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  25  Requisition Entry and Approval Setup Checklist  The checklist below can be used as an example of the steps that need to be performed when setting up requestors and approvers of requisitions. This setup will allow the user to:     Enter and change requisitions     Use the Purchasing/AP inquiry function     View general ledger account inquiry (also referred to as encumbrance inquiry)  Create a user ID and password for each new user entering or approving requisitions     Performed in Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Manager by IT staff  Add user to the EX database     Performed in Common ( Name Entity ) or any other module where   Name Entity  window can be accessed by Human Resources or Registration staff  Add user to Tasklist module     Performed in Tasklist ( Users ) by IT staff  Define groups for each department entering or approving requisitions (one group for department requesters and one group for department approvers  Add members and permissions to the group     Performed in Tasklist ( Group Definition ) by IT staff  Define approval tracks     Performed in Purchasing ( Purchasing Module Setup   Approvals tab ) by Purchasing Manager  Define approval alternates as needed     Performed in Purchasing ( Purchasing Module Setup   Approvals tab ) by Purchasing Manager  Enter requisition entry default row for each requester and approver group     Performed in Purchasing ( Purchasing Module Setup   Create Requisitions tab ) by Purchasing Manager  Add access to GL accounts appropriate to each requisition Tasklist group – use either or both security by component or security by budgeting officer     Performed in General Ledger ( Setup Account Security ) by General Ledger Manager EX Purchasing Learning Guide   26  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  G ENERAL   L EDGER   A LLOCATION   C ODES  You may want to allocate individual expenses across departments or projects for reporting purposes. In this case, a single line item within a requisition or purchase order may need to be divided among more than one general ledger account number.  Separate rows will actually be created on the Transaction History table with the appropriate percentage of the line item according to the general ledger allocation code definition.  1   Click the Create GL Allocation Codes   link on the Create Requisitions or Create PO tab of the  Purchasing Module Setup  window  2   Click the   New   button on the   Allocation Code Control  window  Using the sample shown below, enter a code and select one or more general ledger account numbers that will be used whenever this allocation code is selected  The total percent allocated must equal 100 percent. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  27  D ISBURSEMENT   R ULES  You may want to identify specific guidelines that can be applied to requisitions or purchase orders by defining disbursement cycles.  A disbursement cycle prevents discrepancies between requisitions and corresponding purchase orders and displays the appropriate warning or error message.  If you choose a disbursement cycle on the requisition, only copy or convert the requisition to a purchase order rather than creating a purchase order. This will avoid applying duplicate or conflicting rules to the requisition.  You can create disbursement rules by clicking the Create Disbursement Cycle Rules link on the Create Requisitions or Create PO tab from the  Purchasing Module Setup   window as displayed to the left.  As you will see from the screen capture below, you may define your disbursement cycle code by choosing several types of criteria that will be applied towards the requisition.  Choose from the following components when defining a disbursement cycle:     Assign an approval track     Allow changes to be made to the approval track after it has been assigned to a requisition     Prevent, accept, or display a warning when a purchase order exceeds the amount on the requisition     Prevent, accept, or display a warning when an invoice exceeds the amount on the purchase order EX Purchasing Learning Guide   28  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Chapter 5.   V ENDORS  This chapter will explain how vendors are created and maintained within the Purchasing module.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Create a new vendor     Associate the appropriate government form with a vendor     Change vendor information  C REATING A   V ENDOR  A vendor can be any person, student, or organization to which checks are processed for purchased items or services. Information related to a vendor is saved in the Vendor Master table.  Remember that the vendor must exist in the Name Master before it can be identified in the Vendor Master – therefore, you must enter initial information in the Name Master.  1   Go to the   Create/View Vendors   window EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  29  2   Right-click on ID number, select the   Advanced Search   option, and locate the appropriate name for the Vender Master  3   Click   OK   to select the person or organization and the top portion of the   Vendors  window will be populated with the ID number and name  Basic information about the vendor such as phone number, fax number, and checkbox to indicate a minority status.  You may choose more than one subsidiary account from which checks will be generated for each vendor and, if so, a scroll bar will appear on the right side of the window allowing you to scroll through this window to view all subsidiaries.  To add a new subsidiary, right-click and select the   Add Row   option – enter the same information displayed on the   Vendors   tab for each subsidiary account that is identified for the vendor.  Choose the address that will be used for the vendor when printing purchase orders or any other function that utilizes this information.  Calculated fields are updated by the system.  You may develop certain relationships with vendors where a discount is provided to you whenever an invoice is paid within a certain amount of time. In this case, you can enter a number in the  Discount Days   field that will be used to compare the time between the invoice date and the invoice payable date as well as a discount percent. The discount will automatically be calculated and subtracted from the invoice amount when eligible.  In the example displayed to the left, a 2% discount will be given by this vendor if the invoice is paid within 10 days of the invoice date.  If your payment terms with a vendor allows the same discount to be given to you regardless of when the payment is made, you can enter 999 in the   Discount Days   field and the agreed upon discount percent.  Select the government form that will be used as the default on all transactions created for this vendor – the default selected here will appear on the window when you create a new invoice at which time you may decide to change the form if necessary for one or more particular invoices.  For more details, see the section on   Form 1099 .  You may identify as many as four accounts and associated percentages of the invoice amount that will be applied towards each account – percentages must total 100%.  The accounts that are identified here will be displayed whenever an invoice is created for the vendor – this is especially useful when the transactions for a vendor generally involve the same account numbers.  Use scroll bar to view more than one subsidiary for vendor if it exists. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   30  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Form 1099  When you associate a vendor with a default 1099 form on the   Vendors   tab, the vendor is displayed in Step 2 of the Government Forms Filing Wizard. When the minimum dollar amount paid to the vendor is met, the default form is automatically created.  If for some reason the vendor requires 1099 forms to be produced whether or not the minimum requirement has been met (as opposed to the default selected on the Vendors tab), use the   Required Govt Forms   tab.  In this case, the vendor will also be displayed in Step 2 of the Government Forms Filing Wizard even if there are no transactions for the reporting year.  Basically, there is a difference between the Govt form type default that is identified on the   Vendors  window (shown below) and the forms selected on the   Required Govt Forms   tab.  The default will automatically be associated with the vendor applied each time an invoice is created for the vendor. At the end of the year, if the vendor has met the minimum requirement, the form will be created. On the other hand, the forms that are selected on the   Required Govt Forms   tab will be generated for the vendor no matter if the minimum requirements have or have not been met.  1   Click the   Electronic Payment   tab to enter details for paying a vendor through a direct deposit EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  31  One vendor can be associated with several electronic payments; however, the beginning and ending dates may not overlap each other.  While the setup for electronic transfers is done per vendor in the Purchasing module, the actual Electronic Payment is performed in the Accounts Payable module.  2   Click the   Web Sites   tab to enter a URL associated with the vendor  Any window in the Purchasing module that displays a vendor ID number will also provide a link to the Web Site that has been identified on the window above. You can simply click the link and be directed to the Web Site.  You may define more than one Web Site fo r a vendor   –   in this case, when you click  the link from within the module, an intermediate window will be displayed so you can choose the appropriate URL. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   32  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Generating 1099 Forms  Any selections made on the   Required Govt Forms   tab of the   Vendors   window will take precedence when creating 1099 forms.  Using the illustration above, assume that the 1099-INT form has been selected as the default for a specific subsidiary on the   Vendors   tab.  This means that if the vendor meets the minimum IRS requirements in transactions for the year, the 1099- INT form will be generated.  If the vendor has NOT met the minimum IRS requirements in transactions for the year, and the vendor still requires this particular form, you must select 1099-INT on the   Required Govt Forms   tab.  Now the 1099-INT form will be generated for the vendor in any case since it has been selected on the  Required Govt Forms   tab.  If for some reason you decide to NOT send the 1099 - INT form to the vendor but it has  already been selected on the   Required Govt Forms   tab, you can remove the   Create Form   checkbox from Step 2 of the Government Forms Filing Wizard and proceed to Step 5 where the vendor will be skipped when the form is printed.  The actual Government Forms Filing Wizard is available from the Accounts Payable module. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  33  C HANGING   V ENDOR   I NFORMATION  Depending on the category of data that needs to be changed, there are two locations where you can modify vendor information:     Name Master     Vendor Master  As mentioned earlier, a vendor must exist in the Name Master before it can be identified in the Vendor Master. Therefore, if you need to make any changes to the name, type, organization code, address, phone, fax, relationships, or attributes, you will need to access the Name Master.  On the   Vendor s window, right-click in header and select the   Name Entity   option     This will open the   Name Entity   window in Common so you can make the necessary changes.  After you have made changes to the Name Master, the changes will also be reflected in the Vendor Master.  Details on the vendor such as the subsidiaries, accounts, government forms, electronic payment information, and contact person can be viewed and changed directly on the   Vendors   window from within the Purchasing module.

A PPROVALS  This chapter will provide details on establishing approval tracks for requisitions and utilizing the automated approval track feature.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Build an approval track by identifying members and assigning dollar amount limits for each member     Create a rule that will be utilized when a requisition meets the defined criteria  U SING   A PPROVAL   T RACKS  The approval track feature can be used to identify persons responsible for approving a requisition before the purchase order can be generated. You can choose one of the two options available on the Purchasing Module Setup window to assign approvers:     Manually by requester     Automatically by the system  When you choose the   Manually by requester   option, you will be able to choose an approval track from the drop down menu when a requisition is being created. The screen capture below shows the   Approval Track   field available in the header of the   Create Requisition   window:  When you choose the   Automatically by the system   option, you will not be able to choose an approval track at the time a requisition is created since the   Approval Track   field will not even be displayed in the header of the   Create Requisition   window:  Jenzabar recommends that you use the automatic method to prevent others from changing an approval process and utilize the control that is established through the definition of your approval tracks. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  35  1   Access the   Approvals   tab of the   Purchasing Module Setup   window  2   Select the automatic process for assigning approvers to requisitions  A message will be displayed indicating that the approval track process about to be established will take precedence over any other defaults since the automatic method has been selected.  3   Click   OK  You can also determine the steps that will occur when a requisition has been approved or denied.  4   Use the two preferences displayed to the right which are located on the Approvals tab of the   Purchasing Module Setup   window  For more details on encumbrances, see   Setup Options   in Chapter 8. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   36  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Building Ap proval Tracks  There are five basic steps that you need to perform when building or creating your approval tracks.  1   Select the link  displayed in the screen capture to the left on the Approvals Tab of the   Purchasing Module Setup   window  2   Click the   Create   New  Track   button  3   Enter a name (referred to as Track ID) and description for your approval track  Create a name for the approval track  Assign members/approvers to the approval track  Define the approved dollar amount for each approver  Select the order for approvers   Create a rule EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  37  4   Select available names from the left side of the window and use the   Add   button to move these names to the right side of the window  o   This is your approver list  5   Enter a dollar amount for each member of the approval track which will be used to determine if approval is required  Examine the list of approvers displayed in the screen capture above – KHARMON will need to approve any requisition over $5,000; DDD will need to approve any requisition over $2,500 and up to $4,999; and RJB will need to approve any requisition over $1,000 and up to $2,499. Therefore, if a requisition totals $3,000, both DDD and RJB will need to approve the requisition because it is over their respective limits, but KHARMON will not review it because it is under her threshold of $5,000. If the requisition totals $2,400, only RJB will need to approve the requisition. If a requisition were less than $1,000, in this instance, no approval would be needed.  6   Click   OK   and when you return to the   Approval Track   window, your new track will be displayed EX Purchasing Learning Guide   38  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  7   Now you can click on the track rule icon next to define specific rules for this approval track  If you do not yet have a rule defined, the following message will be displayed:  This feature utilizes the same rules based update functionality that is available in other modules. The APRTRACK type and code has already been established for you within the rules based update functionality and will automatically be selected. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  39  8   On the   Results Definition   tab, select the rule that will be defined  9   Click the   Results Rules Definition   tab  Before defining your rule, consider the following:     Columns from both the TRANS_HIST and TRANS_HIST_EXT tables will be available when defining your rule. Before a requisition has actually been saved, the information will only be available on the TRANS_HIST_EXT table; therefore, when you begin to choose your criteria, keep this in mind.  In the example illustrated above, the rule established will find all requisitions that have been created against account 1-5010-6040-0 or 1-5040-6050-0 since this is the SQL select that has been identified for the resulting code of 01COMP. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   40  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Therefore, the two account numbers that have been selected on the   Results Rules Definition   tab have been identified with the 01COMP approval track. Whenever you create a requisition using one of these numbers, the approval track will automatically be assigned to the requisition since you have chosen the automatic method on the   Purchasing Module Setup   window as illustrated below:  10   Click the   Submit for Approval   button  Since account number 1-5010-6040-0 has been used on this requisition, the 01COMP approval track will automatically be assigned to the requisition and a description of the requirements will be displayed: EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  41  11   Click   Submit   and you will be receive a message that your requisition has been successfully submitted  You may want to click on the View Track Members icon (highlighted below) before you submit your requisition:  This will allow you to view a list of all approvers that have been assigned to the approval track.  Depending on the rules that have been established and the number of accounts or line items, more than one approval track may be assigned to a requisition. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   42  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  A PPROVAL   T RACK   C OMPONENTS  You will find that several components interact with the Approval Track feature as illustrated below.

R EQUISITIONS AND   P URCHASE   O RDERS  This chapter will identify the most efficient methods used to define and create requisitions and purchase orders.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Identify default profiles that can be associated with a requisition or purchase order     Create, review, change, approve, and submit requisitions     Define inventory codes     View graphical statistics on account numbers     Add files and comments to a requisition     Export window data to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet     Generate a purchase order from an existing requisition or create a new purchase order  D EFINING   O RDER   P ROFILES  You may recall the section entitled   Preferences and Contact Profiles   in Chapter 3, which describes the ability to create your own profile containing contact information such as name, email address, photo, position, phone numbers, address, etc. Whenever the contact profile icon is displayed within the Purchasing module, other users can click the icon and view the details that you have identified to be shared within your profile.  Similar to the contact profiles, you can also choose to identify elements or components related to requisitions which are referred to as order profiles.  You can define your own personal order profiles or create profiles that can be used by others.  By creating an order profile, you can easily save either header information or line item details of a requisition. Then, when you would like to create a new requisition, you can select the order profile which will insert the information directly into the requisition window and simply change any components to fit your specific needs.  Use order profiles to improve the efficiency of creating similar requisitions. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   44  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  An order profile can be created for either the header or line item information for a requisition. Depending on the area selected from the   Create Requisitions   window, you can edit, add, or remove a header or line item order profile by clicking on the appropriate icon as illustrated below:  For the purpose of illustration, the Computer Order profile (which has already been defined) is chosen from the header drop down list and the edit icon is selected. This will allow us to view the components that are identified in the header of the Computer Order profile:  Once this header order profile has been defined, you will not need to continuously enter this same information each time a similar requisition is created. Rather, you can simply choose the Computer Order profile and the components shown in the screen capture above will automatically be inserted into the new requisition.  Notice that the header order profile components are displayed on the Set Purchasing  Preferences, Suggest a Vendor, and Designate as a Work Order section of the  Requisition   window. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  45  Notice the two links – Google Maps is delivered with the module and you can define the vendor's URL on the Vendors window.  You may also choose to define order profiles for line items. In this example, the Paper Order profile contains specific details related to the inventory code, unit, cost per unit, catalog number, etc. of the line item.  When the checkmark next to an account number is green, this indicates that the  account is under budget. When the checkmark next to an account number is red, this indicates that the account is over budget. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   46  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  If you do not want a line item to be combined into a single purchase order when creating purchase orders from requisition detail, do not select the   OK To Group   checkbox. This will ensure that a separate purchase order will be generated for each individual line item that does not have the   OK To Group  checkbox selected.  C REATING   R EQUISITIONS  Requisitions are entered into the system as requests for one or more items that will eventually become purchase orders. A requisition consists of two main components: EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  47  Header     General information related to the entire requisition such as  o   Order profile  o   Disbursement rule  o   Approval track  o   Requester  o   Vendor name and address  o   Purchasing agent  o   Delivery location  o   Work order  Details     Specifics on each individual item identified in the requisition such as  o   Expense account  o   Inventory code  o   Catalog item  o   Description  o   Part number  o   Cost per unit  o   Associated project  1   Click   Create a New Requisition   from your activity center  2   Choose a header order profile which will automatically populate the fields with the default information that was defined in the profile  o   Optionally select a disbursement rule and approval track for the requisition  3   Click the   Assign   button and all of the defaults from the order profile will populate the respective fields on the   Create Requisition   window  You may also make changes to any of the components that were automatically populate through the order profile to fit your needs for each individual requisition, if necessary. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   48  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Inventory Codes and Preferences  You can define identify inventory codes for commonly used items so that the details associated with the code will automatically default into the line item when selected on the   Create Requisitions   or   Create Purchase Order   window.  1   Click the   Create initial or modify inventory codes   link on the   Create Requisitions   tab of the  Purchasing Module Setup   window  If you do not select the   Populate inventory code drop downs with vendor specific  inventory codes   checkbox, the vendor ID number column will not be editable and the default of 999999999 will appear as the vendor ID number for all new line items.  2   Enter information related to the inventory code including a preferred vendor  o   Whenever the inventory code is selected, the details that have been identified for the inventory code will default into the requisition EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  49  Notice that you can associate a vendor ID with an inventory code.  If you choose to do so, you can also select the   Populate inventory code drop downs with vendor specific inventory codes   checkbox on the   Create Requisitions   tab of the   Purchasing Module Setup  window. When a vendor is associated with one or more inventory codes, all of the codes for a specific vendor ID will be displayed and you can choose the appropriate one for a requisition line item.  When you choose this checkbox, you will need to select a vendor on the   Suggest a Vendor   tab of the  Create Requisition   window before choosing your individual line items that have been associated with the vendor.  You can also configure your Purchasing module to automatically check all vendors and determine the lowest pricing for a specific item or manually perform this action by selecting a right-click option.  In this case, you can also identify the difference between costs that will be considered when performing this comparison.  This feature is an excellent way to practice cost effective purchasing methods. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   50  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Entering Requisition Details  After the header information for a requisition has been identified, you can begin to add the details.  As you can choose to use an order profile for the header of a requisition, you may also do the same for the details of a requisition. In the example shown below, the Paper Order profile has been chosen and, after the   Assign   button has been clicked, the information that has been identified with the profile will populate the fields for the line item.  REMEMBER: If you have chosen to use vendor specific inventory codes on the Create Requisitions tab of the Purchasing Module Setup window, you must first select the vendor on the Suggest a Vendor tab before assigning a detail line item.  When a green checkmark appears next to an account number, you are within the amount that has been budgeted for this account.     A red X indicates that the account is over-budget  1   Click the green arrow to view a graph and statistical details on the account as illustrated below EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  51  2   Click the   Change Graph Type   link in the bottom right of the   Budget Lookup  window and choose any type of graph to display the budget details  3   When all of the details have been added to the requisition, click   Save EX Purchasing Learning Guide   52  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  4   The   Submit for Approval   button will become enabled and you can click it to submit your requisition If you are utilizing the Approval Track feature, the requisition will be sent to the person identified on the approval track; otherwise, the following message will be displayed:  You will be notified that the requisition was successfully submitted along with the number that has been assigned to this specific requisition.

E NCUMBRANCES  This chapter will provide details on encumbrances - what is an encumbrance, when is an encumbrance generated within the Purchasing module, how is an encumbrance identified, and why and how do encumbrances have an effect on the budget.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand the impact of encumbrances     Recognize transactions and their respective source codes that are generated from an invoice     Unencumber a purchase order     Select the appropriate setup to determine the manner in which an encumbrance is handled when a purchase order is denied  S ETUP   O PTIONS  Directly related to encumbrances, you will find three options available when a requisition is denied. The setup options for encumbrances can be found on the   Approvals   tab of the   Purchasing Module Setup  window.  As discussed earlier in this chapter, whenever a requisition is created, an encumbrance occurs. Therefore, once a requisition has been denied, you can choose one of the options displayed in the screen capture below:  Leave encumbered,  don't delete  The amount of the requisition will be counted against the budget until the  requisition has been deleted. This option will continue to impact the budget.  Unencumber,  delete  Releases any encumbrance that has been created and deletes the requisition  when it has been denied. Any comments or attachments that have been associated with the requisition will also be deleted.  Unencum ber, don't  delete  Releases any encumbrance that has been created but does not delete the  requisition when it has been denied. This option allows you to copy the contents of a denied requisition into a new requisition along with any comments or attachments that may have been associated with the requisition.  R ECOMMENDED BY   J ENZABAR EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  67  W HAT IS AN ENCUMBRANC E ?  An encumbrance is any liability, contract, purchase order, payroll commitment, or tax that has been charged towards a specific account. Once an encumbrance has been identified, this amount is no longer accessible and affects the available balance in the account or budget.  After the encumbrance has been paid, the actual amount becomes an expense.  When you create a requisition or a purchase order, the amount of that requisition or purchase order is an 'encumbrance' – that is, the money has been allocated even though the goods or services may not yet been received and the invoice has not yet been paid.  An unencumbrance is created by either:     Generating an invoice     Creating a manual unencumbrance  To explain the concept of encumbrances, two different case studies are illustrated below.     Single Line Item Purchase Order  o   Demonstrates the process and transactions that occur when the purchase order is created and an invoice is generated for the entire purchase order     Multiple Line Item Purchase Order  o   Demonstrates the process and transactions that occur when the purchase order is created and a partial invoice is generated against the purchase order  o   Demonstrates a manual unencumbrance that is performed against the remaining line item and respective amount EX Purchasing Learning Guide   68  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Case Study:   Single Line Item Purchase Order  The illustration below displays a screen capture of a budget lookup that was performed during the creation of purchase order number 1160 in the amount of $15 against this specific account:  By examining the numbers, you notice the following:     This account has an existing encumbrance amount of $96,175.74 (83% of the budget) indicating that these funds have already been allocated     The unsaved amount of $15 represents the new purchase order that is being created     The account currently has a remaining YTD free balance of $17,411.76 (15% of the budget)  After your purchase order has been saved, the $15 will be removed from the unsaved amount figure and added to the encumbrance as illustrated below:  Once a purchase order is saved, the encumbrance increases by the amount of the purchase order. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  69  Remember that encumbrances can be identified when you create either a requisition or a purchase order.  Take a closer look at the details of the $15 purchase order:  In this scenario, the purchase order is comprised of one line item for $15 and when this screen capture was taken, an invoice was not yet created.  When you access the Accounts Payable module to create the invoice for this purchase order, you'll notice that there is only one line item to be included on the invoice as illustrated below:  Transactions occur behind the scenes – however, if you were to utilize a SQL script on the TRANS_HIST table, you will be able to actually see these rows. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   70  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Below is a breakdown of the source codes and their respective transactions:  One PO transaction will be generated for every line item within the purchase order  For every invoice that has been generated against a purchase order, two IV transactions (positive and negative) in the same amount will be displayed  For every paid of IV transactions, you will see a corresponding @@ transaction with a negative amount  Therefore, when the invoice shown above is created, the following transactions will occur:  Source  Code  Numbe  r  Amoun  t  @@   1160   -15.00   Unencumbers the encumbrance due to the invoice  IV   175   15.00   Adds the $15 to the expense account (Debit/Expense)  IV   175   -15.00   Credits the $15 to accounts payable (Credit) – the entry to Cash is made when the check run is completed and the DB group is created  PO   1160   15.00   Occurred when the purchase order was created  This is the encumbrance transaction itself  Any transactions with the @@ source code identifies an unencumbrance.  Taking a look at purchase order 1160 again, you'll see that the detail has changed:  There is no amount remaining on purchase order 1160 after the invoice is created and the transactions above have taken place. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  71  Case Study:   Multiple Line Item Purchase Order  In this example, we have created purchase order 1161 with two line items:  When you perform a budget lookup on this account number, you'll see the following:  Notice that the total amount of purchase order 1161 ($45 for two line items) has been added to the encumbrance amount and therefore decreased the free balance. EX Purchasing Learning Guide   72  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  When you access the Accounts Payable module to create the invoice for this purchase order, you will only select one line item for the invoice as illustrated below  In this case, you will partially invoice for only the paper line item which totals $30. When the invoice is created, the following transactions will occur:  Source  Code  Numbe  r  Amoun  t  @@   1161   -30.00   Unencumbers the encumbrance due to the invoice  IV   176   30.00   Adds the $30 to the expense account (Debit/Expense)  IV   176   -30.00   Credits the $30 to accounts payable (Credit) – the entry to Cash is made when the check run is completed and the DB group is created  PO   1161   15 .00   Occurred when the purchase order was created  This is the encumbrance transaction itself  PO   1161   30.00   Occurred when the purchase order was created  Taking a look at purchase order 1161 again, you'll see that the detail has changed: EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  73  There is an amount of $15 remaining on purchase order 1161 after the invoice is created and the transactions above have taken place since this was a partial invoice; therefore, the $15 is an encumbrance.  If you decide that the pens are no longer needed or will be ordered at another time, you will need to perform a manual unencumbrance for the remaining $15. This will release the encumbrance on the $15 and will add this amount back to your free balance for the account.  1   Open the   Unencumber Purchase Orders   window  2   Click   Get POs   button to populate the window  3   Locate the purchase order number that you wish to unencumber and click the   Select  checkbox  4   Click the   Unencumber   button EX Purchasing Learning Guide   74  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  We recommend that you use the current date (default) for the unencumbrance rather than entering a new date which might create inconsistencies within your accounting structure.  However, when liquidating the encumbrance from a prior fiscal year, you must use a date from the fiscal year in which the purchase order itself was created otherwise the free balance for the current year will be inflated.  For example, if the current fiscal year is July 2009 – June 2010 and you are clearing an encumbrance in August 2010, you should use a June 30, 2010 date so that the unencumbrance credit will not calculate as an increase in the free balance for the 2010/2011 year.  A new transaction will be created for this invoice as displayed below:  Source  Code  Numbe  r  Amoun  t  @@   1161   - 30.00   Unencumbers the encumbrance due to the invoice  @@   1161   -15.00   Manual unencumbrance  IV   176   30.00   Adds the $30 to the expense account (Debit/Expense)  IV   176   - 30.00   Credits the $30 to accounts payable (Credit)   –   the entry to  Cash is made when the check run is completed and the DB group is created  PO   1161   15.00   Occurred when the purchase order was created  This is the encumbrance transaction itself  PO   1161   30.00   Occurred when the purchase order was created  If you delete a purchase order before invoicing has occurred, any encumbrance associated with the purchase order is erased from the database and no record of the encumbrance will exist.  When a purchase order has already been invoiced, you will not be able to delete the purchase order since the appropriate transactions have been generated.  Y EAR   E ND   P URCHASE   O RDER   M AINTENANCE  At the end of your fiscal year, you will want to examine your open purchase orders and determine the course of action to handle your expense accounts. It is important to understand the impact of budgets, purchase orders, and payments that may overlap between two fiscal years.  When a purchase order is created, the budget is encumbered for the total amount of the purchase order  When an invoice is linked to a purchase order and saved or posted, the budget is encumbered for the amount of the invoice and the expense (DR) and accounts payable (CR) General Ledger entries are created  When an invoice is paid, the accounts payable (CR) and cash (CR) General Ledger entries are created EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  75  Let's take a look at a couple of examples to examine the actions that define the end result.  Scenario:   Purchase order and invoice occur in the same fiscal year  Action   Date   Result  Create Purchase Order  $100  Purchase Order date 06/01  Prior fiscal year  Budget ENCUMBERED   $100  Post Invoice  $100  Transaction Date 06/07  Prior fiscal year  Budget UNENCUMBERED  Expense Debited  AP Credited  $100  $100  $100  Pay Invoice  $100  Date on Check 06/12  Prior fiscal year  AP Debited  Cash Credited  $100  Impact     Since all activity occurred in the same fiscal year, the budget properly reflects the remaining available budget for the year which is $0.     The expense and cash activity is also reflected in the same year.  Scenario:   Purchase order created in prior fiscal year – invoice received and paid in new fiscal year  Action   Date   Result  Creat e Purchase Order  $100  Purchase Order date 06/01  Prior fiscal year  Budget ENCUMBERED   $100  Post Invoice  $100  Transaction Date 07/07  New fiscal year  Budget UNENCUMBERED  Expense Debited  AP Credited  $100  $100  $100  Pay Invoice  $100  Date on Check 07/12  New fiscal year  AP Debited  Cash Credited  $100  Impact     Activity within the budget has crossed fiscal years. The prior year's budget is ENCUMBERED by the purchase order. The invoice was posted in the new fiscal year so the UNEMCUMBRANCE is applied against the new budget rather than the prior year.  o   Therefore, the prior year's budget will indicate that budget funds are still encumbered by $100. Meanwhile, the new fiscal year's budget will show available funds that are overstated which could cause you to exceed your budget by $100 in the new fiscal year.     The expense is recognized in the new fiscal year even though the purchase was approved and the order placed (expense incurred) in the prior fiscal year.     The cash activity is reflected in the new fiscal year because the check was actually issued to pay the invoice during that time.  To avoid cross-year budget effects, you can use two methods: EX Purchasing Learning Guide   76  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Method A  Adjust Activity Dates  In order to correctly update the prior year's budget and recognize the expense in the fiscal year in which it was incurred, you need to adjust the activity dates as follows:  Scenario:   Purchase order created in prior fiscal year – invoice received and paid in new fiscal year  Action   Date   Result  Create Purchase Order  $100  Purchase Order   date 06/01  Prior fiscal year  Budget ENCUMBERED   $100  Post Invoice  $100  Transaction Date 06/30  Prior fiscal year (rather than 07/07 new fiscal year)  Budget UNENCUMBERED  Expense Debited  AP Credited  $100  $100  $100  Pay Invoice  $100  Date on Check 07/12  New fiscal year  AP Debited  Cash Credited  $100  $100  Impact  By backdating the invoice transaction date, budget activity occurs in the same fiscal year and the budget properly reflects the remaining available budget for that year which is $0. Also, the expense is recognized in the prior fiscal year – a true reflection of when the expense was incurred.  By setting the invoice payable date in the new fiscal year, the invoice will be captured and paid in the new fiscal year so cash activity is reflected in the new fiscal year which is when the check was actually issued.  You can backdate the invoice as long as the prior fiscal year remains open – once the year is closed, you cannot use this method. EX Purchasing Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  77  Method B  Close original purchase order in the prior fiscal year and– open new purchase order in the new fiscal year  Scenario:   Purchase order created and closed in prior fiscal year – new purchase order opened in new fiscal year – invoice received and paid in new fiscal year  Action   Date   Result  Create P urchase Order  $100  Purchase Order date 06/01  Prior fiscal year  Budget ENCUMBERED   $100  UNENCUMBER Purchase  Order $100  Purchase Order Date 06/30  Prior fiscal year  Budget UNENCUMBERED   $100  Create new Purchase Order  $100  Purchase Order Date 07/0 1  New fiscal year  Budget UNENCUMBERED   $100  Post Invoice to new Purchase  Order $100  Transaction Date 07/07  New fiscal year)  Budget UNENCUMBERED  Expense Debited  AP Credited  $100  $100  $100  Pay Invoice  $100  Date on Check 07/12  New fiscal year  AP Debited  Cash Credited  $100  $100  Impact  By UNENCUMBERING the original purchase order, the purchase order is closed and budget activity occurs in the same fiscal year. The budget reflects the remaining available budget for that year which is which is $0.  By creating a new purchase order in the new fiscal year, you can apply both the ENCUMBRANCE and the UNENCUMBRANCE in the new fiscal year. Also, both the expense and cash activity is recognized in the new fiscal year  Use the following EX options to UNENCUMBER the original purchase order:     Unencumber Single Purchase Order (for individual purchase orders)     Purchase Orders Not Invoiced Report (for multiple purchase orders) EX Purchasing Learning Guide   78  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Unencumbrance Amount Calculation  How is the uncumbrance determined and in what way do the invoice and purchase order amounts influence this amount?  Invoice Amount   Purchase Order Total   UNENCUMBRANCE Amount  Scenario 1:   Invoice = Purchase Order  $100   $100   $-100  Scenario 2:   Invoice > Purchase Order  $150   $100   $100  Scenario 3:   Invoice < Purchase Order with Invoice Partial Box Checked  $75   $100   $-75  Scenario 4:   Invoice < Purchase Order with Invoice Partial Box Un - checked  $75   $100   $-100     The UNENCUMBRANCE amount for Scenario 1, 2, and 3 shown above are correct.     The UNENCUMBRANCE amount for Scenario 4 is incorrect – $25 should be remaining on the purchase order but the illustration above decreases the purchase order remaining amount to zero.  Budget Exceeded Test  Budget for New Fiscal year   $250  Enencumbrance from prior fiscal year, applied to the new year in error   $-100  System interprets available budget is:   $350  Another way to look at this is:  (-100) + 350 = 250  Now let's examine the manner in which the budget exceeded test will return very different results with and without the unencumbrance.  Assume you have issued a purchase order in the amount of $275.  Without unencumbrance  If $275 > $250 then \"yes\", give warning  With unencumbrance  If $275 > $350 then \"no\", no warning given  This shows how you may exceed your budget and not realize it.",
