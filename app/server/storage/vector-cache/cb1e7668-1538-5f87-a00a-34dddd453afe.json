There is no   live database access. This obligates us to  deliver a nightly data feed to the Phaors 360 system.  AS BUILT INFORMATION  All of the SQL code and scheduled tasks reside on the database server, JZROX - SQL1. C: \\ Pharos folder.  All of the SQL queries are in   the “sqlfiles” folder. These are called by the SQLCommand tool. The data extracts are stored in the “datafiles” folder prior to being sent via SFTP to the Pharos server.  There are 2 scheduled tasks. The first one Extracts the data. The second one   transfers the data via  SFTP. Both scheduled tasks make calls to DOS Batch command files. Routine configuration of the data feed (year and term preferences) is to be performed by staff members  utilizing the SSRS
