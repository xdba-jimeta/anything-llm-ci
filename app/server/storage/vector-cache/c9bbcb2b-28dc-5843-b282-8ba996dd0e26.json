1010 in Major with Priority 1= 1 and Priority 2=1 (1,1, Y) and yes, reuse.     Then in Core you set XYZ 1010 with Priority 1=2 and Priority 2=1 (2,1, N) no reuse.     Now all the required courses in every Major will be the same (1, 1, Y). This works!  I got this all figured out, I’ll be done in no time!  5 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     Curriculum met and now XYZ 1010 is part of a new program. HSR Major and Minor now offered.     I will set XYZ 1010 in the Minor as (1,5, Y). I got this!     Wait! What’s the institution’s policy on sharing Major and Minor courses? No, no sharing!     What? PSY Major requires XYZ 1010 and student just declared HSR Minor and XYZ 1010 went to Major first (1,1, Y) and my Minor priority is set up (1,5, Y) then the Core, but No, I don’t want it in Major AND Minor. Ok, I will just Bypass Minor...  What? Why not? Well then, I will make it fit!  6 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.

Session 187 Round Pegs and Round Holes Not in AV.pdf\npublished: 7/28/2024, 12:35:07 PM\n</document_metadata>\n\nJenzabar, Inc.  Too many Alterations, Bypass! Now what??     I bypassed XYZ 1010 so many times this week!     Should I re-think my tree building? Nah, Curriculum is just stupid.     What should I do? Hit up the list-serve?     Too many Alterations and Bypasses is an indicator that your trees are not running at top production.     First things first, I suppose I can’t assume every course goes to Major first, then Core. I have Minor’s, Certifications and Curriculum rules to follow.   7 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Do not try to fit it! Work smarter, not harder!  No Square Pegs in Round Holes, but if every course is a Round Peg, doesn’t it need a Round Hole?  Who said every course is a Round Peg?  8 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.  Think outside the box!  Courses are as individual/unique as you are  Build your trees based on the importance of the course, NOT the importance of the AIM.  9 © 2014 Jenzabar, Inc.     This is why it is very important to know your Institutions requirements Inside
