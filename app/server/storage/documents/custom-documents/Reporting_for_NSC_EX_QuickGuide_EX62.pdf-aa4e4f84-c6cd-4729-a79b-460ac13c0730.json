This document is designed to familiarize you with the EX processes related to the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) reporting for   DegreeVerif y and   EnrollmentVerify   services.  If you do not already have a license for Advising, we HIGHLY recommend purchasing the Advising module. The Advising module is the mechanism that EX has to know how courses contribute to a program. Without Advising, you will need to manually report on course contribution for each program.  W HAT IS   N ATIONAL   S TUDENT   C LEARINGHOUSE   (NSC) ?  The National Student Clearinghouse is a nonprofit/nongovernmental organization and the nation's trusted source for education verification and student educational outcomes research. The Clearinghouse is the leading provider of educational reporting, verification, and research on behalf of its participating institutions to the nation's colleges and high schools, student lending community, the Department of Education, state and other educational agencies, students and alumni, and thousands of employers and other organizations.  Schools who plan to use the NSC program must contract with the NSC as your school's National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) reporting agent. By this arrangement, you use the NSC as a free alternative to reporting directly to the NSLDS. You can contact the NSC at:  National Student Clearinghouse  2300 Dulles Station Blvd. Suite 300  Herndon, VA 20171  (703) 742-4200  For more information about the National Student Clearinghouse and their services, go to:  http://www.studentclearinghouse.org/ .  V ERIFICATION   S ERVICES  There are two verification services offered by the National Student Clearinghouse:     EnrollmentVerify enables you to refer any commercial enrollment verification request to the Clearinghouse for secure, immediate response.     DegreeVerify frees your school from the burden of verifying degrees for employers, background search firms, and recruiters.  The verification services from NSC include:  secure, automated verifications for students and alumni  easy-to-use online management tools  felxible on- demand reporting  audit trail of verifications EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   6  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  How Verification Services Work  Reporting Sch edule  You will need to determine the reporting schedule for your organization with the NSC. The timing and frequency of reports depends on your school's calendar and whether you use semesters or trimesters. Most schools on a semester system generate a report three times during each term:     At the time no further drops/adds are permitted (can be the Census date, if used)     At the mid-term date     At the end of the term  In addition, at the end of the spring term, you will have to send a Graduates Only Report (Degree Verification) if graduates were not reported at the end of the term. For “non-standard” terms, such as summer, you will typically report only at the end of the term.  Since school calendars and student populations vary, obtain advice from the Clearinghouse to help you determine how often to report, and when, and whether or not to include certain categories of students in your reports. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  7  R EPORT   D ATA   R EQUIREMENTS  The NSC, on behalf of NSLDS, has some specific data requirements for reports and formatting.  You are required to report a group of related records for each FICE/branch combination. You must include:     One Header record identifying information about the school (FICE and branch codes) and about the year/term (description, date of the report, whether it is a \"standard\" term)     Multiple student detail records containing each student's SSN, name and address, birth date if known, enrollment status, and, when required, status date and anticipated graduation date     One Trailer record giving the total number of records in the group of records and a count of all records in each of the status codes; this count includes the Header and Trailer records  Although the NSC reports are used for financial aid purposes, you must report information on all enrolled students, not just students currently receiving financial aid. Reporting on all eligible students ensures that no students who need to be reported are skipped. You may need to make sure that students in the following categories are included:     Students who are writing a thesis or dissertation     Students who are enrolled at your school but are currently taking course work at another school under a cooperative arrangement  The following students should not be included in the reports are those who are not eligible for Federal student loans, including:     Foreign students who do not have a valid Social Security Number and who are not eligible for Federal student loans     Medical students who are in internships or fellowship programs and who are not eligible for Federal student loans     Students who are taking courses at your school but who are enrolled at a different school (visiting students)  For detailed information on which students need to be included and which students need to be excluded, see the guidelines from the NSC or contact your NSC representative. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   8  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  U SING   EX   FOR   NSC   R EPORTING  Jenzabar EX Registration provides automated functions for generating the reports you send to NSC. NSC's definitions of some data they want may be different from the way you define those items, which may include full time/part time status and enrollment status (withdrawn, leave of absence, etc.). Registration helps to translate your data into NSC data.  NSC reports provide enrollment data and status for all enrolled students (with the exception of excluded individual students). EX Registration provides the required enrollment data, which will then be matched via Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to the loan data on file. The goal is to find out which students are and are not enrolled in some college or university in case they have received Federal financial aid loans for enrollment in any college or university. In addition, NSC requires you to report information that you may not currently track, such as an anticipated graduation date for each student.  When using EX to transmit your data to NSC, there is a four-step process.  1   Ensure all of your tables in EX are setup and configured properly  2   Prepare your data then check your prepared data for inconsistencies, and missing or incorrect information (correct as needed)  3   Create your final files  4   Send your files to the National Student Clearinghouse via the FTP  Use the following guidelines when creating NSC reports:     Include all data for a student under a single ID #     Students are identified through the NSC by their Social Security Number, so the correct SSNs must be entered into the Biograph Maser     Make sure each student has a Legal Home Permanent (*LHP) record in the Address Master     Birthdates are optional, but will be reported if the information is entered in the Biograph Master  F ILE   T RANSFER   P ROTOCOL   (FTP)  Jenzabar EX provides functionality that allows you to collect and transmit data to NSC using a secured FTP site.     Data is collected using a single ID Number or customized query     Collected data can be edited before creating the final transmission file     During the update of the file, the submitted records can be protected by placing a lock or warning message on the record     An edit report and other customizable reports related to the collected data are available     The NSC history tables store all submitted records  Setup Tables  Prepare Data  Create Files  Send to NSC EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  9  Troubleshooting the Secure FTP  Use this troubleshooting checklist when transmittals are not processing via Secure FTP from within EX registration. It is necessary to isolate why the file is not FTP’ing to the National Student Clearinghouse. Please complete all the steps below to rule out what the culprit may be.     1   Take the transmittal file (.TXT file) and log into NSC’s website to see if you  can FTP the file to NSC outside of the EX registration module.   Instead of logging into EX Registration to FTP, you’re going to log into NSC’s website and try to FTP this way.   If you’re not sure how to FTP the file on NSC’s website, then contact your NSC representative and ask for assistance.  o   If you   CAN   successfully FTP via NSC’s site, then this tends to indicate there is no firewall or network issue with your institution being able to FTP. Proceed to step #2.  o   If you   CANNOT   successfully FTP via NSC’s site, then make sure you used a valid login/password provided by NSC. This also tends to indicate a firewall and/or a network security issue. Please work with your IT department regarding the firewall – as this is not a Jenzabar EX software issue.     2   Log into EX.   Go to the NSC Configuration window.  o   Verify the secure FTP login and password is what you used with item #1 above. Edit as needed and save.  o   Make sure you have a row marked as the ‘default branch’. Update as needed and save.     3   Make sure MoveIt Freely software is   installed all PC’s that wil l be FTP’ i ng   an  NSC transmittal file.   This third party software piece must reside on the PC’s that are FTP’ing.  o   Please note that the MoveIt Freely software is required for accessing the National Student Clearinghouse Secure FTP site and is not included in the EX software installation wizards.  o   To download and install MoveIt Freely, please visit the   IPSWITCH   website at  http://www.ipswitchft.com/products/moveitFreely/index.aspx#   and click the Download link there.     4   On each machine a user is going to send NSC files to the NSC website, the  registry file needs to know the path where MOVEit Freely is installed.   Double- check the path to the registry.     5   Attempt to FTP the transmittal in EX using the TE_ADMIN login.   If you do not know the TE_ADMIN password, please work with your IT department to complete this step in the checklist.   If TE_ADMIN can transmit, then this would indicate a task list security issue for the user that could not FTP.   Work with your IT department to resolve this. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   10  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  C ONFIGURING   EX   FOR   NSC   R EPORTING  There are several windows in Registration and Advising you will need to configure before working with NSC verification reports.  Best Practice: If you are using Jenzabar’s Financial Aid Manager module, be aware that many of the same tables used for NSC reporting are also used for COD reporting. Be sure to setup your NSC tables to help your Financial Aid office process financial aid requests. The NSC setup is required for your Financial Aid Office to transfer the program information they must transfer to PowerFAIDS for COD reporting.  A CCESSING   NSC   W INDOWS IN   EX  You will find the windows necessary for NSC reporting in the   Reports- National Student Clearinghouse   Activity Center.  There are several setup and configuration windows you may need to setup or update; however, unless this is your first time running NSC reports, most of the tables should already be configured.  Sometimes, especially if you are a new user or you recently upgraded to a newer version of EX, you may not be able to see all of the NSC windows in your Activity Center. If that happens, and you usually have access or you think you need access, you should contact your Activity Center Manager to gain access to all of the NSC Reporting windows.  For information on how to  organize your Activity Centers and windows (similar to the layout in the screenshot), check out the Beginner’s Look at EX Quick Guide available on MyJenzabar.net EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  11  C ONFIGURING   R EGISTRATION  On the   Registration Configuration   window, you will need to decide which NSC functions you want to use, and how you want to calculate program enrollment.     Checkbox   Function  Make Use of NSC  Functionality  When selected, the NSC menu items will be displayed in the Registration module.  Report all NSC  Columns  This checkbox is selected by default if you have the   Make Use of NSC  Functionality   checkbox selected. You must clear the Report All NSC Columns checkbox if you do not wish to collect and submit certain data elements to NSC; however, if you do not submit this information, your students will not be able to use the Student Self-Service option and Student Tracker will not be available to you.  Perform Cross  Student Tables  Update  Select this checkbox to display a prompt when the Entrance Year and Term is updated on the   Student Information   window. The prompt will allow you to update the Student Division Master and Degree History tables.  Disp lay Cross  Student Table  Updates Prompt  This checkbox is made available only if the   Perform Cross Student Tables  Update   checkbox is selected. Selecting this checkbox will allow a prompt to display so you can specify input parameters.  The   For Program Enrollment Use   drop-down box will allow you to determine how your program enrollment statuses will be calculated. You can choose to use your   Advising Requirement Trees  (recommended) or you can choose to use the   Advising Program GPA Profile . If you choose   None , or if you do not own a license for the EX Advising module, you will have to manually calculate program enrollment. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   12  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Other Registration Windows  In addition to setting up the Registration Configuration window, there are a few additional windows in Registration that you will need to set up prior to running the NSC reports.  Window   Description  CIP Definition   This window allows you to add and maintain CIP codes that are used by the U.S. Department of Education to generate federally mandated reports. You must select the Used in Regulatory Reporting checkbox for each CIP code for which the U. S. Department of Education requires you to report statistics. Each major or certification offered by your institution must be associated with a CIP Code, as this association is needed for the Enrollment and Completions reporting.  Major/Minor  Definition  Each student is associated with a set of codes that represent majors and minors. Valid major and minor codes with their descriptions are defined on the Major/Minor Definition window. You must define a code for each major and minor that may be associated with faculty/staff or past students. This may include majors that are no longer offered or were never available at your organization.  Certification  Definition  You can enter and maintain certification codes and their descriptions from this window. You must select a CIP code for each certification for which the U.S. Department of Education requires you to report statistics.  If you want a certification code to display in the Certification drop-down list on the Majors/Certifications tab of the Program Definition window, you must select the Internal checkbox on this window for that certification.  C ONFIGURING   A DVISING  EX is now using the Advising module to calculate the program enrollment status for students. You will need to configure your system to use either   Advising Requirement Trees   or the   Program GPA Profile  from the   Registration Configuration   window.  Advising Trees vs. GPA Profile  There are several details you will want to take into consideration when choosing between the Advising Trees and GPA Profile options. In the chart below, you can compare the information in each method:  Advising Trees   GPA Profile  Majors        Minors        Concentrations        Certifications        Groups     Maximums and Minimums     Customized Conditions    EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  13  Advising Setup  The setup process for Advising varies depending on which process you will be using to calculate the program enrollment status.  Advising Requirement T rees   Advising Program GPA Profile  1   Confirm the use of Advising Trees for Program Enrollment calculations on the Registration Configuration window  2   Setup Free Elective (*) bucket on the Institutional Requirements Tree window that will track elective courses the students can take to complete their program  3   Setup Administrative (#) bucket on the Institutional Requirements Tree window to catch courses that are forgiven and not part of the program or free elective options  4   Map your Majors, Minors, Concentrations, and Certifications to Aims on the Degree/Aims Cross Reference window  5   Compute Student Progress for each student included in the report  1   Confirm use of GPA Profile for Program Enrollment calculations on the Registration Configuration window  2   Setup Program GPA Profiles for the Majors, Minors, Concentrations, and Certifications at your institution  3   Associate courses with majors and certifications on the Maintain Program GPA Files window  4   Map your Majors, Minors, Concentrations, and Certifications to Aims on the Degree/Aims Cross Reference window  5   Compute Student Progress for each student included in the report  While the Program GPA Profile option is a quicker method for calculation of program enrollment statuses, Jenzabar recommends using the Advising Requirement Trees, if possible. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   14  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Not Using Advising?  If your institution is   NOT   licensed for EX Advising, you can use the   Create Transmittal File   process to create the Transmittal Detail row but will not be able to populate the Program Enrollment Status.     The Create Transmittal File process will populate the NSC Transmittal Detail program buckets with all other information     Work with your IT staff to determine how you might calculate and then update the Program Enrollment Status for each program EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  15  C ONFIGURING   NSC  Once you are certain the Registration and Advising windows are configured properly, you can begin to configure the NSC windows. Use the checklist below to ensure all tables are ready before starting to run your NSC reports.     T ask   Description   Location     Confirm Advising Trees  - or -  Confirm GPA Profiles  Find out which setting is selected for the   For Program Enrollment Use   column   Registration Configuration window     Setup Free Elective Bucket (*FREE)  Efficiently track elective courses that the student can take to complete their program   Intuitional Requirements Tree window     Setup Administrative Bucket (#ADMIN)  Catch courses that are forgiven or that are not in the Program or the Free Electives area   Intuitional Requirements Tree window     Setup Degree Aims Cross Reference  Map your majors, minors, concentrations, and certifications to Aims   Degree/Aims Cross Reference window     Compute Student Progress   Run for each student included in reporting   Compute Student Progress window     Define Credential Levels   Specify details for credential levels   NSC Credential Levels tab on the CIP Definition window     Assign Credential Levels   Select credential levels for each Degree Code   Degree Definition window     Determine Passing Grades   Specify passing grades for Financial Aid   Grade Table Definition window     Define FT/PT Limits   Define values for Three-Quarter Time Upper Limit   Part-Time/Full-Time Definition window  NSC Configuration  The first step in the process is to populate the appropriate values in the   NSC Configuration   window. Because NSC reports group individual student records by FICE and Branch codes, every student record must have the correct codes.  In this window, you will designate the FICE codes and Branch Codes, then indicate if it is a default branch that will be used when generating new student records for NSC. Many schools only have one FICE/Branch designation and will report all students under the same codes. If our school has multiple FICE or Branch codes, you should enter the most common codes as defaults and correct the data records of those students who need to be reported under alternate codes.  If you do not have multiple branches, the Branch code should be “00.”  The FTP site’s DNS Name for NSC will come pre-populated in this table. If you wish to use the FTP connection provided by Jenzabar to upload your file to the NSC Website, you will also need to add your school’s FTP Login and Password. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   16  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  NSC Enrollment Status  The   NSC Enrollment Status   window is used to set up a translation table for converting your codes to the NSC status codes. You will probably want to use the exact same enrollment statuses as those used by the NSC. You can use the suggested codes in the list below; these are the codes that are used for the enrollment statuses in the transmittal files.  Code   Description  These codes must be defined. You must enter values in this window even if your codes are the same as the NSC statuses. If you have any additional codes you wish to enter on the Student Data file, you will need to define them as well.  F   Full time  H   Half time  L   Less than half time  Q   Three Quarter Time  W   Withdrawn  G   Graduated  A   Approved leave of absence  D   Deceased  This table allows you to continue using your codes, if they differ from the NSC codes; however, your codes must be translated into the NSC codes for reporting purposes.  There are two reasons why you might want to use codes or categories different than the NSC's:     You will be porting in data from somewhere else.     You want to use the enrollment statuses to produce InfoMaker reports for purposes other than generating NSC reports.  This window is set up for your convenience; therefore, you are not required to define any additional status codes if your codes correspond with the NSC codes.  NSC Term Definition  For each report, you must indicate whether or not it is a “Standard” term report. The National Student Clearinghouse considers each academic term either \"standard\" or \"non-standard.\" Non-standard terms would usually include summer terms and short terms such as a three-week mid-winter term. There are different reporting requirements for standard and non-standard terms.  Although you have the option to delete terms, normally the term codes do not change; rather, the terms are used repeatedly with different year codes.  Use the   NSC Term Definition   window to designate which academic terms at your organization are standard and which are non-standard. Click in the Term Code column, then click on the down arrow to select a term from the term codes defined in your system's Term Definition table. If it is a non-standard term for NSC reporting purposes, select the   Non-Standard Term   checkbox. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  17  Degree Definition  The next table that needs to be configured is the Degree Definition table. There is a column in this table that indicates the NSC Degree Level. This column is critical in processing the NSC Degree Verification.  The available NSC Degree Level codes come pre-populated with the EX product. Using the drop-down box, populate the appropriate NSC Degree Level on each degree offered by your institution.  The Degree Definition table also contains degrees students will have earned at other institutions. These degrees DO NOT need to have an NSC Degree Level.  Degree Period  The   Degree Period   window allows you to add, view, modify, and delete Degree Periods. Degree Periods are used to:     Identify the actual commencement or graduation periods on the Degree History window and allows organizations to identify every graduation period within one academic year.     Identify the NSC Degree Periods for which the records are being submitted. A Degree Period can include multiple graduation periods to accommodate organizations that submit data to NSC once a year but have multiple graduation periods within that year.  Degree Periods cannot have overlapping dates.  When the final transmittal file is created by the NSC Degree Verification process, the Period Code column is updated on the Degree History table. This column will then be displayed on the   Degree History  window for view only purposes. Once the NSC Degree Verification file is submitted for a specific degree period, that degree period record cannot be edited. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   18  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Other NSC Windows  There are several windows that contain valuable NSC data. Below is a detailed list of the windows you may want to configure:  Window   Description  NSC Part - Time Full -  Time Table  This window allows you to add, view, modify, and delete Half Time (NSC  PT/FT) codes. EX will use the numbers you enter to assign students a status of less than half-time, half-time, or full-time by looking up the courses for which they are registered.  You should maintain this table only if you are not using Rules Based Update to determine NSC registration statuses.  Degree Program Area   This window is used to add, view, modify, and delete Degree Program Area  codes for students.  Degree Program Area codes defined on this window can be added and saved to the student's Degree History record, and the information can be reported to NSC by the Degree Verification Process.  Honors Program   This window is used to add, view, modify, and delete Honors Program codes, which identify your organization's honors programs. You may have a School of Business Honors Program, a Transfer Honors Program, a Science Honors Program, etc. Honor Program codes/descriptions are saved in the Honors Program table.  Honors Program codes defined on this window can be added and saved to the student's Degree History record, and the information can be reported to NSC in the Degree Verification Process.  Definition Windows  There are also several windows used to define, view, and edit data for NSC reporting. Within EX you will need to determine which windows to populate in order to meet the NSC reporting requirements. Definition tables include:     NSC Program Length Type Definition     NSC Special Program Definition     NSC Program Credential Level Definition     NSC Student Phone Type Definition     NSC Veteran Status Definition     Honor Definition     Institutional Division Definition EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  19  R ULES - B ASED   U PDATES FOR   NSC   P ROCESSING  The Rules Based Update functionality can be used to identify your results (such as the FICE or Branch Code) and the rules that will be used to determine if a student fits the criteria. If you use the Rules Based Update functionality, follow these steps to verify your NSC configuration:  1   Confirm that all NSC Update Type and Code combinations are available on the   Update Definition   window  2   Assign appropriate permission for Update Type/Update Code combinations to groups on the   Update Definition User Access   window  3   Define the Resulting Codes and their rules on the   Update Results and Rules   window  Use the   Update Results and Rules   window to access the Rules Based Update functionalities.

You do not need to define a rule; the system will use this FICE code to update every NSC student data record. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   20  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  On the Branch Code Rules-Based Update (NS2), all of your branch codes from the   NSC Configuration  window will be available as resulting codes via the drop-down list.  If you have only one branch at your school, you will not need to define a rule; the system will use this branch code to update every NSC student data record. However, if you have multiple branches, create a resulting code for each of your branches.  NSC   D ATA   B LOCK   I NDICATOR   (NS6)  On the   Name Master   window, there is an available checkbox used to indicate if the individual’s name and information show be private. When selected, the individual’s information should not be released to the public. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  21  When you select NS6 NSC Data Block Indicator, a Y and N will be displayed as resulting codes in the drop-down list.  Students identified with the   Private   checkbox selected on the Name Master will be included with the result set that is returned on this query.  NSC   FERPA   B LOCK   I NDI CATOR   ( NS7 )   AND   NSC   F INANCIAL   B LOCK   ( N S 8 )  When working with Degree Verification reports, you will need to update information blocks that will appear on your report. On the   NSC Degree Verification Data Collection   window, you will need to indicate that you want to use NSC Rule Based Updates to update the FERPA and Financial blocks. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   22  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Clearinghouse FERPA Block  Students have the right to request that none of their academic information, including graduation information, not be released to a third party. Since The National Student Clearinghouse is a third party, institutions need to exclude those students from the information submitted. This is done using the NS7 Clearinghouse FERPA Block Indicator Update Rule.  On the   Results Definition   tab, the resulting code of ‘Y’ will automatically populate because this process will update the NSC_DEG_VERIF_DETAIL.FERPA_BLOCK with a ‘Y’ if the student has indicated they do not want their information released to a third party.  On the   Results Rules Definition   tab, you will be looking for the name_master.is_ferpa_restricted column (this is the checkbox on the Name Master window). If the checkbox is selected, the value in the column will be ‘Y’ so make sure there is a value of = to ‘Y’ in the rule shown above. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  23  Clearing house Financi al Block  Occasionally, a student may have an outstanding balance at the time of your report. If you want to see a list of students who have a Balance to Date greater or equal to a set amount, you can create a rule on the NS8 – Clearinghouse Financial Block Indicator Update Rules that will indicate a financial block.  Since the Business Office hold (which is financial) is entered into the student_master.hold_1_cde, this is the column you will use to validate a financial hold.  The example rule above is written to validate that this column IS NOT null, and when the rule is run, it will validate that this column is not null so the financial block will be placed on the student’s information for Clearinghouse.

You will need to define a set of criteria that a student need to meet in order to be considered a “good student.” You may require a student to meet any of the following criteria:     Grade point average of \"B\" or higher for the recent term     Cumulative grade point average of \"B\" or higher     Dean's List student     Top 20% Class Rank  In the example below, a student must have a term GPA of at least 3.2 and an overall GPA of at least 3.0 to be considered a “good student.” EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   26  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  NSC   PT/FT   S TATUS   (PFN)  Click the   +   in front of the   PFN   to open the   NPF   rule. Highlight the rule and add a row in the bottom of the window to add your resulting code. You should always create the first rule for the value of the greatest number of students.  Your next step is to highlight the resulting code and click on the results rules definition tab. You will then create the rule that will determine this code be assigned to the student. Repeat this process until all three values of   F   (Full-time), Q (Three Quarter-time),   H   (Half-time) and   L   (Less-than-half-time) have been created.  Once all of the rules have been created, you will then need to indicate in the   Registration Configuration  window that you will be using the   Rules-Based Update   process for both the   PF/FT Definition   and the  NSC PT/FT Definition .  These boxes CANNOT be checked until the rules have been created. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  27  NSC   E NROLLMENT   R E PORTING  The purpose of the Enrollment report is to provide data and status for all enrolled students. The NSC Program Enrollment Report in EX will provide the required enrollment data that will then be matched, via Social Security numbers (SSNs), to the loan data on file. The result is to find which students are still enrolled in some college or university, and which are not, if they have ever received federal financial aid loans for enrollment in any college or university. The maintenance of data and the preparation of transmittal files for reporting purposes will be in the Registration module only. No data maintenance in or data retrieval from the Financial Aid module will occur for the NSC report.  EnrollmentVerify enables you to refer any commercial enrollment verification request to the Clearinghouse for secure, immediate response.  If you have the Advising module up and  running with Advising Trees, and you perform these steps, you will be able to calculate Program Enrollment Statuses.  If you do not own the Advising module, you will have to devise a manual method of collecting students’ program enrollment statuses for NSC Enrollment Verification reporting.

NSC Maintain Student Data Records  From the   Maintain Student Data Records   window, you will run a process to either initially create the Student Data Records table or update an existing table, and store student information.  Run the NSC Maintain Student Data Records process for the specific year/term     Select to   Create New Records   and  Update Existing Records   and Update/Overwrite all information  Be sure to select the all of the overwrite options.     You can access the Update Results and Rules window by clicking the  Define Update Rules   button     Click   Process  If you run this process more than once, EX will add any new student information to the table and skip any existing records without making any updates to the existing files. You will have to update existing files manually from the NSC Edit Student Data Records window.  Only one student data record per student can exist; but there must be a record on the Student Data Records table for each student in order for a student to be included on the NSC report.  Running this process will ensure that you have the latest information in the NSC Student Master table for the students in that specific year/term. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  29  NSC Edit Student Data Records  After you have created the student data records, you may need to work with the records to add or edit information collected when you ran the Maintain Student Data Records process. The   NSC Edit Student Data Record   window will allow you to manually work with individual student records. You can use this window to:     Manually create a record for students who are not enrolled in any classes     Change an existing record for a student     Enter a student status     Exclude a student from the report  This window is the final editing place for fields on Student Data Records, prior to generating a new NSC Enrollment report.  After editing any student data records, we recommend that you run the   NSC Update PT/FT Hours and Status   window one final time for the year/term for which a NSC report is being prepared as a final safety update run.  Step Two:   NSC Update PT / FT and Status  The NSC Part time/Full time widow is used to set up the rules for the program to determine each student’s status, according to the number of PT/FT hours enrolled. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   30  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  One record must be entered on this table for each combination of Division and Term. If any information is missing, this will result in a blank status on the report file.     Half-time upper limit: If a student’s hours are greater than the Half-time upper limit, student status = “F”, Full-time     Less than half-time upper limit: If a student’s hours are greater than the Less than half-time upper limit and less than or equal to the Half-time upper Limit, student status = “H”, Half -time or more, but less than Full-time     If a student’s hours are less than or equal to the Less than half-time upper limit, student status = “L”, Less than half-time, but still enrolled     If a student was enrolled but the hours now equal zero, student status = “W”, Withdrawn  For every combination of division and term at your organization, you need to enter the maximum number of credit hours a student can take to be considered \"less than half-time\" or \"half-time\" by your organization.  When the system updates students' NSC part time/full time status by looking up the courses they are registered for, it will exclude courses if they have been:     flagged with certain type codes that can be defined for exclusion using the   Credit Type Definition  window     awarded certain grade codes that can be defined for exclusion using the   Grade Definition  window  Step Three: NSC Edit Registration Transactions  The   NSC Edit Registration Transactions   window allows you to edit records already created by the Update PT/FT Hours and Status function. This editing step allows you to revise data that has been created by the program; you can view, add, change or delete all or selected records. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  31  When you create NSC transmittal files, the system:     Reads the NSC student data records and sorts them into groups by FICE and branch codes     Adds student information from the Name and Biograph Masters     Compares students' current status codes with their status codes stored in the NSC History table and decides which students need to report status start dates for this report     After it has completed the comparison, it replaces the data in the NSC History table with the current data; this becomes the new history table for the next time the report is run     Generates the header and trailer records the Clearinghouse requires with each set of student data  Your new data will replace the existing data in your NSC Transmittal History table.  Because you may need to reuse your existing history data, you should to back up older information.  Make sure that this table contains the data you want before you run this procedure. This is the final editing place for fields on Registration Transaction Records, prior to generating a new NSC report.  You may periodically need to run a mass maintenance to clear out the oldest records as the file increases in size; however, NEVER delete data until you and the Clearinghouse. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   32  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  Step Four: Populate NSC Transmittal and Final Files  Before you can create a transmittal file, you will need to populate the Transmittal tables. From the   Create NSC Transmittal Files and Final Files   window, you will need to go to the   Populate Transmittal Tables  tab and enter the parameters for the process and click the   Populate Transmittal Tables   button.  This process will capture data from the NSC Student Data Record table and the NSC Registration Transaction table and compare the data to the data submitted in a previous NSC report. Once the process is complete, the NSC tables will be created and populated.  EX will use the data in the NSC Transmittal History table to compare old and current student data. Make sure this table contains the data you want before running the Create procedure.  The Header, Detail, and Trailer files are always cleared at the beginning of a report run; this ensures that only current data will be used for the new report run.  Do not skip this step. This process will back up the Transmittal History file from the previous report run. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  33  Step Five:   Print Transmittal and Exception Reports  Once you have populated your NSC tables, you need to make sure your information is complete and correct. You will need to run two reports and crosscheck your information before you create your transmittal file.  NSC Print Transmittal File Records  From th e   NSC Print Transmittal File Records  window, you will be able to print a report that allows you to review the data created on the  Create NSC Transmittal and Final Files  window. Reviewing this data will help you determine if you need to edit any of the Detail, Header, or Trailer records.  This report is sorted by FICE/Branch/SSN to match the Report file that will be sent to the Clearinghouse. Check for records flagged as   **Blank Status . These records should be corrected before sending the file to the Clearinghouse. The two most likely causes for a blank status are:     Either the student does not have a current division entry or the division code does not match a record on the NSC Part time/Full timetable. There must be a record on the NSC Part-time/Full- time table for each possible combination of Division and Term.     The NSC Enrollment Status table does not have a record that matches the Special Status value stored for students on the Student Data file. This may happen if you used a mass maintenance to fill in the Special Status. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   34  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  If you have many records missing statuses, you must go back and perform the following steps to create corrected Transmittal files:  If you have only a few errors, you may want to correct the records manually from the NSC Transmittal (Header, Detail, Trailer) Records windows.  NSC SSN Exception Report  When you provide reports to the National Student Clearinghouse, you should NOT include information on students who for any reason are not eligible for Federal student loans. This includes any student who does not have a valid Social Security Number.  Any student without a Social Security number (SSN) is excluded from the Transmittal Files. The   NSC SSN Exception Report   will list any students processed who have no SSN and also checks for duplicate SSNs. Only the first student with a SSN is included on the Transmittal File and counted in the totals. The other students with the same SSN are reported on the SSN Exception report. It is important that you verify the data on the NSC SSN Exception Report and correct any SSN problems in your files.  If you have only a few errors, you may want to correct the records manually from the NSC Transmittal (Header, Detail, and Trailer) Records windows; otherwise, you will have to re-run the process as indicated in the previous section.  Add any needed entries to the   NSC Part Time/Full Time Table  Run   NSC Update PT/FT Hours and Status   to create one NSC Registration Transaction file record for the added entries  Restore your   NSC Transmittal History   file from backup  Run   Populate Transmittal Tables   from the Create NSC Transmittal and Final File window EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  35  Step Six: Review and Verify   NSC Transmittal Records  The student information reported to the Clearinghouse is grouped by FICE and branch code. Each set of data includes a header record, the student detail records, and a trailer record. After you have created the transmittal files used to generate reports to the National Student Clearing House, you may need to edit header records manually. There are three transmittal record windows you will work with in NSC: Header, Detail, and Trailer.  Header   The header identifies what student records are included in this set of data. It includes:     FICE and Branch codes     Academic term     Standard report (Yes/No)     Certification date     Report level  Detail   In the Detail window, you can add, delete, or edit a student record. The following student information appears in this set of data:     FICE and Branch codes     SSN     Previous SSN (for SSN changes)     Name (Last, First, Middle Initial, Suffix)     Previous last name (for name changes)     Enrollment status     Start date of current status (only reported for some reports and statuses)     Birth date (if available)     Graduate Level Indicator     Data Block Indicator  Trailer   If you add or delete a student or change a student's status, you will also need to edit the trailer record. The trailer contains the following information:     FICE and Branch codes     Total \"F\" (Full Time)     Total \"H\" (Half-Time Or More)     Total \"L\" (Less Than Half-Time)     Total \"W\" (Withdrawn)     Total \"G\" (Graduated)     Total \"A\" (Approved Leave of Absence)     Total \"X\" (available for a new status in the future)     Total \"D\" (Deceased)     Total Records in File, including header and trailer records  Be careful when editing transmittal records; the system will not check the validity of your entries. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   36  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  NSC Transmittal History Records  Each time the Create NSC Transmittal Files function is run, an NSC Transmittal History table is created with the results of the previous run. These transmittal history records will be used in the next reporting cycle to the NSC to determine changes in students' statuses. They are also used to identify changes in students' names and SSNs.  If any corrections are made to a student’s status or status date on the Transmittal Detail file, you need to make the same correction on the Transmittal History file.  Step Seven: Prepare the Final NSC File  When you are satisfied with the information generated in your Transmittal Detail Records and the SSN Exception report, you will run the process to create the transmittal file. On the   Prepare Final File(s)   tab of the   Create NSC and Final Files   window, you will select your FICE and Branch code and click the  Create History Rows and Final Transmittal File...   button. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  37  When you click   OK , the process will run gathering information from your Header, Detail, and Trailer records.  When the process is finished, the   View/Send Final Files   tab will open.  Step Eight: Send Final Files to NSC  Once you have prepared your final files and reviewed all your information, you are ready to send your file off to the NSC. You will also have one final chance to view the file on the   View/Send Final File s tab of the   Create NSC Transmittal and Final Files   window.  When you are ready to send the file to the NSC, click the   Secure FTP   button to submit the Final Transmittal File. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   38  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  FAQ S FOR   NSC   E NROLLMENT  Below you will find several questions concerning the data and processes for creating an Enrollment report for NSC.  Q:   We do not   use/ have the EX Advising Module, will we be able to process NSC Reports in EX?  A:   Since you do not use /have   A dvising ,   EX   will not be able to calculate each program's  enrollment status for you. Work with your IT staff to explore how they could help you calculate a program enrollment status.  Q:   What if a student is in more than 6 programs?  A:   NSC has only provided 6 buckets. We will populate the 6 buckets first with majors from the Current Degree, then majors from any other Active row(s). Certifications are used in a similar order.  Q:   How are elective courses calculated towards the program credit load if they are not  specified in the Advising Tree, even if the program allows electives?  A:   The *FREE Bucket will be included in the calculation. Once the *FREE Bucket is MET (through When Met Then Met), then any courses that don't fit the other trees, and no longer fit in *FREE, would then no longer be counted toward the student's program.  Q:   I understand the process wil l be looking at Majors/Certifications, but will it be looking at the  Concentration field as well?  A:   Yes. If the Concentration is associated with a Major in the Concentration Definition window, then when the Major Aims are gathered, the Aims for the associated Concentration will be added and the process will check to see if the courses contribute to the student's program.  Q:   If a student is only enrolled in credits applying to their minor, are they considered eligible  for financial aid?  A:   If there is a major/certification on the student's Degree History row on which the minor resides, then the courses contributing to the minor will be evaluated for inclusion in the eligible hours; however, if there is only a minor on a given Degree History row, then the courses contributing to the minor will not be evaluated for inclusion in eligible hours.  Q:   What will be best place in EX to see what NSC enrollment status has been reported?  A:   When you have collected data for an NSC Transmittal File, then you can see the information in the NSC Transmittal Detail window. After you have generated the text file that gets sent to NSC, then you can see what was reported in the NSC Transmittal History window.  Q:   We keep every past degree as “active” even aft er graduation, and simply add a new row if  the student returns for an additional degree. Can we keep this process, or do we need to change the way we handle “active” degrees?  A:   EX uses the Degree History Active column to know the degrees a student is   currently seeking.  We recommend that when the student is no longer attending or has graduated the Degree History Active checkbox is unchecked. All Completed Degrees should be locked.  Q:   We don’t do NSC reporting, do we still need to setup the table s?  A:   Yes, the NSC setup is required for your Financial Aid Office to transfer the program information they must transfer to PowerFAIDS for COD reporting.

EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  41  D ATA   C OLLECTION AND   T RANSMISSION  To begin the process of creating a Degree Verification report, you will need to access the   NSC Degree  Verification Data Collection and Transmission   window.  Step One: Create/Open a Batch  When you first open this window, an additional window will open showing you all of the batches that have been created. You have the option of selecting one of the batches for update, or creating a new batch.  If you are updating a previous batch, highlight the batch and click   OK . If you are creating a new batch, click the   New Batch   button.  This multi-tab window steps you through the process of creating, reviewing, editing, finalizing, and transmitting a Degree Verification file to National Student Clearinghouse (NSC).  The tabs allow you to collect data; edit the detail, header, and trailer records; and prepare and transmit the final file over a secure FTP connection, which must be set on the NSC Configuration window. The reports on the Reports tab should be run and reviewed after the initial data is collected, when additional data is appended, and/or when records are updated. EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   42  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  At the creation of the final file, the record in Degree History can be updated with the NSC Period for historical data references. In addition, the Lock Flag can be set to   L   (lock for edit) on the Degree History table during the creation of the NSC History records. Previously submitted degrees are protected from being modified or deleted. Once the record is locked, it becomes a view-only record. This lock can be removed or changed by permission only.  The window is available only if the Make Use of NSC Functionality checkbox is selected on the Registration Configuration window.  Step Two: Collect Data  The   Collect Data   tab is used to configure all parameters necessary to collect the required data for the transmittal records, append additional records to an existing file, or update records in an existing file.  The   Populate NSC Tables   button initiates the collection of data. An e-mail message will notify you if a Header record exists with a report date but no NSC Degree History records for the selected FICE/Branch and report date.
