You can only enter or edit grades during a grading period.  I entered grades. Why can't I edit them?  There are separate permissions for those tasks:  •   Can view and enter grades for ungraded courses  •   Can view and update grades for graded courses  Why Can't I enter a Last Date of Attendance?  Some grades (such as withdrawal grades) may require a Last Date of Attendance, but only for final grading periods. If you can't enter a Last Date of Attendance, then either the grade doesn't require it or it's not the final grading period.  Why can't I enter grades in a roll-up section?  This applies only to schools using Competency Based Education. J1 Web 2019.5 Academic Department User Guide   39  For roll-up sections, you grade the competencies. The section grade is calculated from the competency grades. See \"How to Enter Grades for Competencies\" above.  Why is some information out of date?
