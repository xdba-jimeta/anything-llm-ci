As of EX 5.5, the Compute Student Progress process can evaluate non-course requirements using rules-based updates (RBUs).  There are 8 steps to setting up non-course requirements using RBUs:     Define an AVR   Update Type   code in the   Maintain Table Values   window     Define the rule in the   Update Definition   window     Grant access to the rule in the   Update Definition User Access   window     Write the rule criteria in the   Update Results and Rules   window     Define an AVR   Advising Requirement Type   in the   Maintain Advising Requirement Types   window     Define the ARC to represent the rule in the   Maintain Advising Requirements   window     Add the ARC to the appropriate trees and associate it with the rule in the   Institutional Requirement Trees   window  I.   DEFINE THE AVR UPDATE TYPE  a.   Open the   Update Definition   window; right click to   Insert Row  b.   Right-click in the   Update Type   column and select   Maintenance Screen   to open the   Maintain Table Values   window June 2016 2 Page  c.   Right-click to   Insert Row  d.   Type AVR in the   Table Value   column and Advising Rules in the   Table Description   column  e.   Save and close this window to return to the   Update Definition   window June 2016 3 Page  II.   DEFINE THE RULE  a.   On the row you added to the   Update Definition   window in step 1a, select the AVR code you just created as the   Update Type   for your new rule (if you don’t see it in the dropdown, go to   Actions  in the top Jenzabar EX toolbar and select   Refresh All Dropdowns )  b.   Create an   Update Code   that reflects what the rule will be validating; for example, a rule which validates that the student has earned a minimum score of 192 or higher on Step 1 of the USMLE could be coded USMLE1_192.  c.   Populate the   Description   with an English explanation of what the rule is validating, since the description can be visible to students and advisors; for example, the USMLE1_192 example in step 1b   above could say “ Minimum Score of 192 on USMLE-Step 1 ”  d.   Select Validation from the   Process Type   drop-down  e.   Save and close the   Update Definition   window June 2016 4 Page  III.   GRANT ACCESS TO THE RULE  a.   Open the   Update Definition User Access   window  b.   Click on your EX User Group in the top portion of the window  c.   Click on your rule in the   Available Codes   section on the left side of the window  d.   Click the   Add   button in the middle to move your rule to the   Selected Codes   section on the right side of the window  e.   Repeat steps 2b-2d for any other EX User Groups who will need access to your rule  f.   Click the   Close   button to close the   Update Definition User Access   window June 2016 5 Page  IV.   WRITE THE RULE  a.   Open the   Update Results and Rules   window; locate the AVR book in the   Update Type/Code Selection   section in the top left corner of the window and click to expand it; scroll down and click on your rule  b.   In the bottom half of the window, on the   Results Definition   tab, right-click to   Add Row ; the  Resulting Code   will automatically be a Y since your rule was defined with a   Process Type   of validation in the   Update Definition   window  c.   Save June 2016 6 Page  d.   Click on the   Results Rules Definition   tab to write the criteria students must meet in order to be validated as meeting the non-course requirement; for example, if a student must have a USMLE Step 1 score of 192 or higher in order to graduate, your rule should validate against the data stored in the Highest Test Score table. In the screenshot below, the rule is validating that the student has a row in the Highest Test Score table with a Test Code value of USMLE, a Test Element value of MLE01, and a Highest Test score value of greater than or equal to 192  e.   Save June 2016 7 Page  V.   DEFINE THE AVR ADVISING REQUIREMENT TYPE  a.   Open the   Maintain Advising Requirement Types   window; right-click to   Add Row  b.   Type AVR in the   Type   column and Advising RBU in the   Description   column  c.   Select RBU from the   Cluster   drop-down  d.   Populate the   Print Order   to control the way these types of ARCs will sort by default when you add them to a tree  e.   Populate the   Comment   column to describe internally how this type of ARC is used  f.   Save June 2016 8 Page  VI.   DEFINE THE ARC  a.   Open the   Maintain Advising Requirements   window; right-click to   Insert Row  b.   Create an   Advising Requirement Code   that reflects the requirement you need to track; following the example used in steps 1-4, a code of USMLE01 could be used to reflect Step 1 of the USMLE, which is a requirement for the MD program  c.   Populate the   Description   with an English explanation of the requirement, since this will be visible to students and advisors  d.   Select AVR from the   Type   column, which will result in RBU appearing in the   Cluster   column  e.   Populate a   Begin Date   to reflect when you added this ARC to the table  f.   Save June 2016 9 Page  VII.   ADD THE ARC TO TREE(S)  a.   Open the   Institutional Requirement Trees   window; select the   Year   that contains the trees you need to add the ARC to  a.   If the ARC needs to be added to more than one tree in the same year, leave the   Requirement  drop-down blank and click the   Find Now   button to load al l trees in the year you’ve selected ; if  the ARC only needs to be added to a single tree, type the tree’s code in the   Requirement   drop- down and click the   Find Now   button to load only that tree June 2016 10 Page  b.   Drill down into your tree by clicking the little plus sign next to the root so that the requirements beneath the tree are displayed; continue drilling down until the location where you want to drag the requirement is visible  c.   In the   Available Requirements   section in the bottom right hand corner of the window, type the ARC you created in step 6b and click the   Find Now   button  d.   Click on the ARC, and keeping your mouse’s left click button depressed, drag the ARC over to the  tree, making sure you hover over the root or group where you want to put it, so that the root or group is highlighted, before letting go of your mouse  e.   Click on the ARC, now on the left hand section of the window, so that the   Requirement Detail  tab becomes available June 2016 11 Page  f.   Select AVR from the   Update Type   drop-down, and then the   Update Code   you defined in step 2b  g.   Save and click the top   Find Now   button to refresh your view  h.   Drill down into the tree to view where your requirement is sorting; if desired, click on the ARC and then click on the   Options   tab to adjust the   Print Order   value and/or add   Requirement Text   to further clarify the requirement for students and advisors  i.
