June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  SYNCHRONIZE ADVISOR INFORMATION (CONTINUED)  When should I run it?     Great for new EX customers who want  a quick way to add faculty advisors to  the Advisor Master table     Great for existing EX customers who  have recently updated  office/permissions information in the  Faculty Information window and want  to quickly “copy” it to the Maintain  Advisors window  Tips:     Customize the query to ensure you only insert  the correct IDs, keeping in mind the  FACULTY_MASTER table contains IDs for every  instructor who has ever been associated with a  course, not just those who are active today     Typically the process is only used either by  institutions which are new to EX, or those  which have recently updated office or  authorization permissions information in the  Faculty Information window and are looking  for a quick way to “copy” that information over  to the Maintain Advisors window     You do not need to use this process to add  new advisors to the ADVISOR_MASTER table © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.

June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  SYNCHRONIZE ADVISEE INFORMATION (CONTINUED)  When should I run it?     When you’re first implementing EX, after your final conversion pass, once your trees, GPA profiles,  degree/aim cross - reference, and plans are complete and ready to be assigned to students     When you’re re - implementing EX Advising (i.e. building trees for the first time after a hiatus), once  your trees, GPA profiles, degree/aim cross - reference, and plans are complete and ready to be  assigned to students     When you’re implementing EXi Advising, once all of your plans are built and ready to be assigned to  students     When you need to mass - update student aims, GPA profiles, and/or plans for students who were  processed by the Admissions to Registration Transfer, due to timing (your trees, profiles, degree/aim  cross - reference, or plans weren’t in - place at the point in time when the AD to RE Transfer process  ran for a selection of IDs)     When you’ve made a change to the way your trees are built, such as a change from the single - root  to the multi - root system, and you need to mass - update the aims for affected students © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  SYNCHRONIZE ADVISEE INFORMATION (CONTINUED)     Customize the query  •   The <Original> query pulls students enrolled in the default Year/Term     Uncheck any checkboxes that don’t apply to what you’re trying to synch  •   Exception: Create Advisee Information checkbox; the process won’t add an ID to  the ADV_MASTER table if it’s already there     The process isn’t typically necessary on a regular basis since triggers take  care of keeping AV and RE data in - synch  •   Exception: Timing of the AD to RE Transfer process and when you copy/build the  new catalog’s trees, profiles, & plans  Tips: © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  COMPUTE STUDENT PROGRESS/COURSE NEEDS  What does it do?     Inserts/updates rows in the  STUDENT_PROGRESS and/or  STUD_CRS_NEEDS tables  •   Student Progress window  •   Advising Worksheet Report  •   Graduation   Report © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  COMPUTE STUDENT PROGRESS/COURSE NEEDS (CONTINUED)  Where can I see the results?     Student Progress window  •   Maintain Advisees > Maintain  Student Aims > Student Progress  button     Reports  •   Graduation Report  •   Advising Worksheet     JICS  •   Course Needs portlet  •   Degree Progress portlet © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  COMPUTE STUDENT PROGRESS/COURSE NEEDS (CONTINUED)  When should I run it?  In EX 5.5, the process was automated so that it runs automatically on a 1 - 5 minute  interval. As a result, you only need to formally run it, when:     You’ve recently synchronized advisees and want the same population’s student  progress data recomputed without having to wait the 5 minutes     You’ve recently made a change to an individual student’s aims or student progress  data (via an Advising Alteration), and again want the data recomputed without  having to wait the 5 minutes     You’re trying to capture fresh student course needs data to be summed by the  Compute Course Needs process, for course forecasting (i.e. how many students will  need course XYZ, therefore how many sections do we need to offer) © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  COMPUTE STUDENT PROGRESS/COURSE NEEDS(CONTINUED)     Use the Quick Select options, or customize the query to run the process for a select population  •   The <Original> query pulls all students who have at least one row in the STUD_AIMS table (i.e. any/all  students who have aims)     The Course Needs checkbox isn’t default selected, so be sure to check this checkbox if this is the  primary reason you’re running the process  •   Ensure the student population you’re running the process for has a value in the Classification  column in the Student Master table (Student Information window > Student tab), as this value is  required by the STUD_CRS_NEEDS table     The Course Needs update does not first delete rows in the STUD_CRS_NEEDS table, so over time the  table will contain rows for students who are no longer enrolled and shouldn’t be included in your  counts  •   Ask your DBA to truncate the table prior to running the process (this deletes all rows in the table)  •   Customize the query so that the only rows the process “puts back” are for students who you want to include  in your counts  Tips: © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  COMPUTE COURSE NEEDS  What does it do?     Deletes and then inserts rows  into the CRS_NEEDS_SUM table,  based on the data in  STUD_CRS_NEEDS     Course Needs report     Course Needs Analysis report © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1   -   4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  COMPUTE COURSE NEEDS (CONTINUED)  When should I run it?     When you want to update the Course Needs Summary table to help with course  planning, directly after running the Compute Student Progress process with the  Course Needs checkbox checked  Tips:     Run it with no value selected to update the table for all classifications © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.
