In discussing the Advising module, there will be several references made to ‘trees’. Let’s first examine the analogy between trees and the Advising module.  The tree has a root at the bottom, which holds everything together. The branches extend out from the root and leaves grow out from the branches.  By using this same concept in the Advising module, you will notice that the root represents a general requirement – for example, you may have a root of Biology Major. All of your curriculum must fit within your root system – but remember that each tree can only have one root.  The trunk and branches of the tree represents groups, which give the tree substance – such as General Biology, Biology Electives, Scientific Biology, etc.  The leaves represent the courses (ARCs) that

Groups, and individual Courses as illustrated here:  Within the tree structure, we have the following criteria that further define your curriculum:     Parent/Child Relationships     Control Mechanisms     AND/OR     Grid     Grade  Parent/Child Relationships  In the Parent/Child relationship within the tree data structure, the parent node (root) is composed of children (values and

BIOMAJ   AND   Course 1   To satisfy the BIOMAJ requirement, a student must successfully complete Course 1 AND Course 2 AND Course 3 AND Group 1 AND   Course 2  AND   Course 3  AND   Group 1  Group 1   OR   Course 4   To satisfy the Group 1 requirement, a student must successfully complete Course 4 OR Course 5 OR Group 2 OR   Course 5  OR   Group 2  Group 2   AND   Course 6   To satisfy the Group 2 requirement, a student must successfully complete Course 6 AND Course 7 AND   Course 7  Grid  So, what determines when a requirement is successfully completed?

However, if this only pertains to one specific major, then do it on the Advising side.  What is an ARC?  An Advising Requirement Code (ARC) is an abbreviated description of a course that is used to identify its equivalency within meeting a defined set of requirements. This equivalency plays a very important role in three key areas:     The advising process     Prerequisites and corequisite checking     Repeat logic  If you do not have Advising Requirement Codes (ARCs) on the Student Course History, you do not have an Advising module – this is one of the first places to turn if your Advising module is not providing you with the desired results.

The Beginning Accounting course is accepted as the equivalency for the Accounting I for Beginners course but how will the Advising system recognize this?

Consider the fact that you may have a transfer student with courses that do not fit into any of your offerings. Therefore, you may way to create a Wildcard ARC called   FREE ELECTIVE . This AIM should be associated with a Cumulative type and you can place all of these transfer courses into the AIM

You will then be able to transfer in as many as 10 courses for each department. This structure can be built directly into your tree – nothing needs to be done in Registration, only in Advising.  Let’s take a look at a specific scenario as it relates to cross-listed courses.  You have three courses with three ARCs: SOC150 (SOC150), PSY150 (PSY150),  ECON150 (ECON150).  The same instructor teaches these courses in the same room. If each course has a different ARC, what will happen if a student takes   PSY150   in the fall, does not pass the course, and then takes   SOC150   in the spring? Consider the option of repeat logic.

Therefore, your courses would look like this:  SOC150 (SOC150)  PSY150 (SOC150)  ECON150 (SOC150)  Now when you are building your SOC, PSY, and ECON trees, you will look for the ARC of   SOC150 .

So you may want to set up a spreadsheet that shows the following:  COM410.01 = COM410A   (this is the ARC)  COM410.02 = COM410B  COM410.03 + COM410A   (if repeat logic is applied to the first section, it must have the same ARC)  You will need to track which courses are associated with an ARC and then enter those ARCs in your Section Master (for repeat logic).  What would you do for Independent Study? Create COM410.IS or COM410.I2, COM410.I3 for different instructors.  So, in general, an ARC is equivalent to a course.  Within the Advising module, everything is built on either the ARC table ( Maintain Advising Requirement Codes   window) or the TREE table ( Maintain Institutional Requirements   window). Roots, groups, courses, etc. reside on the ARC table – basically, PSY150 is just PSY150 on the ARC table.

Whereas the ARC table is global, the TREE table is local. Understanding this theory will help you determine where to implement changes to obtain the appropriate results.  PSY150 is changed from a 4-hour course to a 3-hour course on the ARC table. The change is applied everywhere this course exists – that is, every root, group, etc. This is a global change. If this same change to PSY150 is made on the TREE table, the change is applied locally – that is, PSY150 will appear as a 3-hour course only on the tree for the specific student and specific year in which the change was made.

In other words, when you begin to build your PSYMAJ, do you have ARCs such as JEBYM, BELLO, and PSY150? Think about creating a naming convention that is easy to adhere to and one, which allows you to easily drag and drop when building your trees. Therefore, when building PSYMAJ, a more intuitive naming convention might be PSY101, PSY202, PSY303, etc.  In order to separate your ARCs from your IRQs, you can include another letter such  as PSYC for Psychology Concentration or PSYM for Psychology Major – you can also use PSYU for Undergraduate and PSYG for Graduate. Then your ARCs could begin with 5 characters.     Define the children of the major  o   Do you want to create a group under the parent called Major Requirements and then list the courses? Or would you rather place courses directly beneath the parent? Either method is fine – use your catalog and your guideline.

Consider the manner in which information is communicated to students – be concise and clear – use lists and bullet formats. This will eliminate various types of interpretations.     Are your advisors required to sign a course selection sheet during registration? Why?     Are you aware that any document that is officially signed and not disclaimed as part of the contract generally becomes part of the contract?     If your advisors are signing course selection sheets, this indicates that a meeting has occurred between the student and advisor.

This example demonstrates the various components that will need to be defined for your courses in order for the Advising module to be effective:  Courses   Introduction to Biology  Fundamentals of Biology  Science of Living Organisms  ARC   BIO101   BIO201   BIO301  Requirement Type   ROOT   CRS   CRS   CRS  Cluster Code   R   C   C   C  AIM   GENBIO   BIOELT  So, in the general scheme of configuring your Advising module, the following process will occur:  1   Identify your course offerings  2   Assign an Advising Requirement Code (ARC) code to each course  3   Associate an Advising

Therefore, you may choose to create requirement types that are very similar to the cluster codes that will be associated with them. Let’s examine them in detail to further understand their characteristics.     Course – C  o   This requirement is satisfied by the completion of course work.     Group – G  o   This is the parent of a collection of child requirements. It must also be associated with a group relation type code to determine the relationship of the child requirements.     Course Total – CT  o   This requirement reports an unduplicated total of all credits that a student has earned.     Cumulative Credit – CC  o   This requirement specifies that it may accumulate credit each time a course is successfully repeated. For example, this requirement would be appropriate for a music practice course where a student may take the same one-credit hour course each semester for five semesters.

All roots automatically have a group relation type of AND.     Other – O  o   This cluster code specifies that a requirement is not automatically evaluated. It is satisfied by placing a record in the Student Advising Alterations table for the requirement with any credit or status information to be applied to the requirement.  Now that the cluster codes have been explained, you may find it easier to create your requirement types. As mentioned earlier, you can simply create requirement types that replicate the name as its cluster code. For example:  Requirement  Type Code  Requirement  Type Description  Cluster  Code  How is it used in Advising ?

Typically, the amount of courses that are part of the re-use string represents a step along the way – the bypass ‘requirement met by’ type will allow you to manually alter a re-use string so that it ignores one of those steps.

You will probably want to perform as few as possible. The alteration will only last as long as the student is attached to the aim – therefore, if the student changes majors and then returns to their original major, all of the manual alterations will disappear.  For the purposes of CLEP, Military Credit, etc., create organizat ions on the  Organization Master and consider them as transfer institutions.

The MAJOR aim label for Student A was assigned the ARC of ENGMAJ which serves as the root requirement and will be used as the source for evaluating requirements. The same holds true for Student B with the root requirement of ARTMAJ. EX Advising Learning Guide   36  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  If a student has not yet selected a specific major, the student may have an aim label with no ARC.  You may want to use the same name to identify both the requirement type and the aim label. In this case, all requirements designated as the root of a degree major tree will have both a requirement type and an aim label called MAJOR. Therefore, when selecting advising requirement codes to satisfy an aim of MAJOR, all requirements with a type of MAJOR will be obvious.  With this in mind, you may want to identify aim labels called MAJOR, MINOR, CORE, etc. If a student has more than one major, this will allow you to assign two MAJOR aim

This uses the same scheme as the order within a tree structure.   The lower numbers will appear higher on the report and you may want to identify numbers in increments of 5 or 10.   This will affect both the Advising Worksheet as well as the Graduation Audit.  o   You will not identify a print order for individual courses. The Compute Student Progress process loads the courses in the specific order in which they were taken by the student based on the Year Definition sort order, Term Definition sort order and Student Course History student sequence number.

the   Print Tree   button to preview and print a report showing the parent/child relationship of the requirement as well as the requirement details.   This will help you troubleshoot any possible issues that may become apparent later.  Once you have created your institutional requirements for the selected year (which is a very time- consuming task), you will have a structure on which future years can be based.  To copy one or more trees...  1   Right-click on a tree that appears beneath Institutional Requirement Trees and select the   Copy Tree   or   Move Tree   option  2   Enter the Year and Requirement for which this tree will be copied or moved  3   Click on the   Replace Existing Tree(s)   checkbox if you would like to replace the existing tree  4   Click the   OK   button  5   If necessary, you

Before adding a new advisor to the system, you will want to verify that the name does not already exist – avoid duplicates as much as possible.  o   The left side of the window will display a list of current advisors in the system.  o   To edit existing information, highlight a name and click on the   Name Entity   button on the right – here you can make changes to the Name Master.  o   To view a list of advisees assigned to the advisor, click on the   Advisees   button.  o   Click on the   Notepad   button to add a note for the advisor.  o   Click on the   Office Lookup   button to view a

Activating Advisees  In order for the Advising module to function properly, you must have the following three key elements:     Trees     Advisees     Advisors  Even if you have matriculating students in Registration, these students will not be considered Advisees until they have been activated as such.  The Advising system recognizes Advisees by their name type – this is the method used to classify individuals and identify their roles within the system. While the Registration module identifies students (the role of STU) as soon as they have been assigned to a division, an Advisee is identified through one of the following methods:     Added through

Therefore, if you have not yet configured the Degree Aim Cross Reference for all of your students and performed the Synchronize Advisee Information process, all information will be cleared out and will not be able to be re-created. Once the Degree Aim Cross Reference is configured, you will be able to run this process ONE TIME and there will be no need to run it again.  It is important to remember that everything will be cleared out the existing tables when the Synchronize Advisee Information process is performed. Therefore, you will need to be able to recreate this information through the Degree Aim Cross Reference feature.

Regarding errors...whenever a major process is performed and several tables are updated, the system will notify you when errors have occurred within the process. In this case, you will have the ability to view these errors by accessing the application logs that are created and made available to you.  The   Application Log   tracks every process that is run in the Advising module and shows whether the process was a success or a failure. If a failure occurred, you will be able to view the error report and see where the actual error was encountered that caused the process to fail.  You can sort the log by date, process, status, ID number, or user name by clicking on the respective

Deleting relationships will delete the row from the Advisor Student table and set the advisor status to inactive in the Advising History table.  The   Reports   tab will allow you to run any of the designated reports or customize them to fit your needs.  Specifically, when choosing the   r-adv_grp_synch_edit   report, you will be able to then select a date and see the last synchronization along with errors that may require troubleshooting.

Go to the   Synchronize Advising Groups  window.  Notice the two radio buttons in the Inactive Advisees Attributes section.  You may want to select the   Deactivate Relationships   option for students who were active in a previous semester. For example, if a student was enrolled in the Spring 2010 semester and is no longer enrolled in the Fall 2010 semester, the student will not have been chosen by any of the queries or active terms – therefore, you will want the synchronization process to inactivate the student in both the Advisor Student and Advising History tables.

O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand the functionality behind each of the available reports within the software  T YPES OF   R EPORTS  All of the reports can be accessed from the default Activity Center titled Reports - Advising.  Graduation Report  A student’s requirements, the courses that have been taken in order to satisfy each requirement and grades are displayed on the Graduation Report – that is, a student’s progress towards meeting their graduation requirements.  Student Course Needs Report  Course requirements that have not yet been met by the student will be displayed on this report. However, if you need to provide a printed version of this information to students, we recommend that you use the Student Course Needs Letter rather than this report since it is more flexible.
