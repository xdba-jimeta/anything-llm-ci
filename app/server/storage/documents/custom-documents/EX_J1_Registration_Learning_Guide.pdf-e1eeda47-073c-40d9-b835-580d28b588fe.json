E XPLA INING THE   G UIDE  This chapter will provide an overview of the topics that will be addressed during the length of the course.  A GENDA     Examine the infrastructure of the tables within EX Registration  o   Where is specific information stored within the database?  o   How does data relate to each other within Registration?  o   What is the data flow between students, courses, and student courses?  o   Discuss the Common tables  o   Review the main Registration tables  o   How are divisions used within Registration?     Configure EX Registration     Comprehensive review of all configurable items and the impact they have within Registration     Detail overview of the Masters in Registration     Student Information  o   How are students registered for courses?  o   What is the Group Registration feature and how can it be used to facilitate the registration process?  o   What determines the difference between a withdrawn and a dropped course?  o   How are grades entered?     Recalculate academic records  o   How are repeated courses handled within Registration?     Transfer candidate data from the Admission and create student data in Registration  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this guide, you will be able to:     Understand the data flow that occurs within Registration     Recognize the impact of each configurable item and how it impacts major processes     Gain valuable details related to the major tables within Common and Registration     Register a student     Create a course and section of a course     Enter student grades     Determine where and how to locate specific information related to a student     Perform all of the major update processes     Create your own rules-based update     Use a transfer process to import data entered through Admissions directly into Registration  S UMMARY  Jenzabar EX Registration manages all of your vital enrollment data quickly and efficiently, allowing you to easily determine space availability, course conflicts, course prerequisites, and non-course prerequisites. With the ability to verify and update Registration, Advising, and Student Records, Jenzabar EX Registration provides the accurate student data you need to deliver more responsive student service. This course will cover the fundamentals and configuration of Registration. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  7  Chapter 3.  This chapter will explain the terminology used within Registration and illustrate the flow of data between modules and tables.  O BJECTIVES     Understand the manner in which data is stored and maintained in the Registration system     Recognize the most critical tables and how they are used by the system     Utilize the visual representations to gain an understanding of the data flow between tables  I NTEGRATED   D ATABASE  The EX system utilizes an integrated database – each piece of information is stored only once in the database and each office accesses a piece of data when needed.  Record   A collection of relate d columns that refer to one person or entity.     For example, one record may contain the last name, first name, and middle name columns  Key Column   Uniquely identifies a record.   A table can contain more than one key column, which indicates the table may contain more than one record per person or entity.     For example, each record on the Name Master contains a nine-digit ID number that uniquely identifies each student.  Table   Contai ns a group of records. Each record is identified by a unique entry in the key column.     For example, the Name Master table contains a record for every name in the database.  As a student moves through your institution, each office can simply add data to the information that already exists in the database.  The ID number on each table connects the information with the student.  You may find a situation where similar columns exist on the same system. For example, the Applicant Master table contains the   Major 1   and   Major 2   columns that identify an   intended   major at the time the candidate applied to the school. The Degree History table contains the   Major 1   and   Major 2   columns which identify the student’s   actual   major after enrollment has occurred. Although the intended and actual majors often contain the same values, they may differ; therefore, these columns are similar but not exactly the same.  The same situation exists with course tables. The Catalog Master, Section Master, and Student Course History tables have a number of similar columns that usually contain the same values. For example:     The course title on the Catalog Master table is usually identical to the course title on the Section Master. However, there are times when a course title can change slightly by each section.     The course title on the Section Master table is usually identical to the course title used on the student transcript (Student Course History). However, there may be cases where an independent study or transfer course appears on the student’s transcript with a slightly different title than those found on the Section Master table. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  8  Since the similar columns among the Catalog Master, Section Master, and Student Course History usually contain the same values, the programs that create sections and student courses will copy data from the similar columns. Therefore, you will only need to make modifications where the columns contain different values.  D ATA   F LOW   O VERVIEW  The flow of data in Registration is based on four primary groups of tables and information: Common, Student, Course, and Student Course.  The flow is straightforward – you set up student information and course information. When students register, there entities are merged to create student course information.  Student course information drives many of the processes in the Registration system such as printing student schedules, class lists, grade reports, and transcripts as well as storing grade information.  Common  • Information shared by many offices sucha as name and address  Student  • Information about the student such as division and major  Student Course  • Combination of students and courses, including information about each student's course work  Course  • Includes your catalog courses, each section of a course, and schedule informaiton for each section EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  9  Common   Tables  This group contains information that is shared by many offices in the institution such as Name Master, Address Master, Biograph Master, and Organization Master.  Name Master  This is the heart of the EX database. The Name Master table stores the name and name-related columns about individuals and organizations. Each individual or organization has one, and only one, record on the Name Master table with the ID number as the key.  Individuals in the Name Master table may include prospective students, applicants, enrolled students, faculty, staff, and donors as well as colleges, high schools, vendors, and community organizations.  The screen capture below shows a typical entry as it would appear on the   Name Entity   window. Notice that the   Individual   name option radio button has been selected in the upper right portion of the window – this indicates that the information is associated with a person and that all the details highlighted are stored in the Name Master table.  There are three icons on the window that you should be aware of:     Holds   (   ) are represented with the triangle icon to let you know if the student has a hold on their account. To view the hold(s), you can click on the icon to open the Student Holds window.     Notepad   (   ) allows you to make notes and confine the information to just Registration. To add a note, click the icon to open the Notepad window.     FERPA Permissions   (   ) are represented with the open or closed padlock. A green, open padlock means that the student is allowing access to a specific person, while a red closed padlock means that no permissions have been granted. When you click the padlock icon, the FERPA Permissions window will open.  FERPA information is entered on the FERPA Permissions window. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  10  Address Master  The Address Master table stores one or more addresses for each individual and organization on the Name Master table. The key consists of the ID number and address code. By using different address codes, you can store more than one address per person or organization.  The screen capture below shows the same entry displayed earlier as it would appear on the   Name Entity  window and Address tab. Notice that the   Individual   name option radio button has been selected in the upper right portion of the window – this indicates that the information is associated with a person and that all of the details highlighted are stored in the Address Master table. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  11  Biograph Master  Biographical information such as date of birth, ethnic background, and marital status is stored on the Biograph Master table. Organizations do not exist on the Biograph Master table – only students, faculty, staff, and donors.  The screen captures shown on the next page show the same entry displayed earlier as it would appear on the   Name Entity   window and Biograph tab. The   Individual   name option radio button is selected in the upper right portion of the window – this indicates that the information is associated with a person and that the details shown on this tab are stored in the Biograph Master table. Notice that the   Old Ethnic Group   is left blank on the Biograph Master subtab. Ethnic and Race information is now shown on the Ethnic/Race subtab. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  12  When creating InfoMaker reports, the most common information about individuals will be found on the Name Master, Address Master, and Biograph Master tables. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  13  Organization Master  Every organization must first exist in the Name Master table before they can exist in the Organization Master table. The Name Master table will store the name and ID number of the organization while the Organization Master table will store information such as business/organization type, number of employees, institution type, and organization code.  The screen capture below shows a typical entry as it would appear on the   Name Entity   window. Notice that the   Business/Organization   name option radio button has been selected in the upper right portion of the window – this indicates that the information is associated with an organization and that some of the details are stored in the Organization Master table.  This organization code may include one of the following:     America College Testing Program (ACT) provides a set of four-digit codes of postsecondary institutions     College Scholastic Services (CSS) provides a set of four-digit numbers     College Board provides a set of numbers (CEEB or CEEBACT)  o   High schools use a six-digit number  o   Post-secondary institutions use a four-digit number     National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) issues IPEDS codes used for IPEDS reporting EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  14  Course   Table Relationships  Similar to the common tables, course tables (such as Catalog Master, Section Master, and Section Schedules) contain information that is shared by many offices in the institution.  The diagrams shown below represent the relationships between the definition tables and the master tables.  Catalog Master  The Catalog Master table contains one record for each of the courses offered at your institution. In most cases, you will have a one-to-one relationship between the Catalog Master table and the courses listed in your course catalog. Usually, the information in this table will only change when you create a new catalog or special course offerings. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  15  Section Master  The Section Master table contains one record for each offering of a catalog course. For example, if Art History is offered twice in a term, the Section Master table will contain two records of Art History for the term. The Section Master table also maintains section information for each year and term – therefore, this table can be used to track current term section information, set up future sections, and store historical information about sections.  Section Schedules  For each Section Master record, one or more Section Schedule record exists. This table stores meeting times, places, and professors for each course section. Since you may create as many as 99 schedule master records for each section, you may keep track of many meeting times on this table such as in the following circumstances:     A section meets at different times on different days     A section meets in different rooms on different days     A section may have one meeting time for part of the term, and another meeting time for the remaining part of the term     Different professors may teach the course during the term EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  16  Student Table Relationships  Keep the following concepts in mind:     The Student Master table contains one record for each student (past and current)     Each student has one record on the Student Master, Name Master, and Biograph tables     The Degree History sequence number on the Student Master table indicates which Degree History record is active for the student     The Current Division Code on the Student Master table determines which Student Division Master record is currently active for the student     The Student Term Summary table and the Student Term Summary by Division table contain more than one student record per student – students have records in these tables for a year and term only if they enroll for courses during that term  Student Master  The Student Master table anchors the student information tables. Each student from your institution has one record on the Student Master table. The table contains current information about each student – keyed on the ID number – and has a one-to-one relationship with the Name Master table. Therefore, every student will have one Student Master record and one Name Master record.  Student Master Extension  The Student Master Extension table contains information that can be used for your own institutional tracking purposes. By default, the information contained in this table   is not   used for IPEDS reporting. The information contained in this table can be used when using a custom query to select students for the IPEDS data collection process. Each student may have one record on this table.  Student Division Master  The Student Division Master table contains the academic record for each student. The academic record consists of Grade Point Average (GPA) details. The table has one record per student per division. Therefore, if a student has taken both graduate and undergraduate courses, two records will exist on the Student Division Master table. Each record will store the GPA within its division.  If a student has more than one Student Division Master record, the system will need to know which record contains the student’s current division. The Student Master table contains a   Current Division   column that indicates which division is current.  When you create InfoMaker reports, you can link the Student Division Master table to the Student Master table by using the ID number and the Current Division columns. The InfoMaker report will use GPA details from the current Student Division Master record.  Student Term Summary  The Student Term Summary table contains one record per student per year and term. This table exists primarily to keep track of the part-time/full-time status of each student for each year and term. The totals on this table reflect all of the courses that the student has taken within a term. Use this table to analyze enrollment and attrition at your institution.  A Student Term Summary record is generated when a student registers or preregisters for a year and term. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  17  Student Term Summary by Division  Student GPA information for each division, year, and term is stored on the Student Term Summary by Division table. When you update grades for a term, the GPA will reflect the student’s GPA at the end of that term.  If you look at the 2011/12 term for a student who graduated in 2013, the GPA as of the time the 2011/12 grades were updated will be displayed. The transcript and grade report processes will use this table to print term GPA for current and past terms. You may also use the Student Term Summary by Division table to view a history of a student’s GPA.  A Student Term Summary by Division record is generated when a student registers or preregisters for a year and term.  Since students typically take courses from one division in a term, the Student Term Summary by Division table often contains information that is similar to the Student Term Summary table. However, a student may take an undergraduate course and graduate course in the same term. Since these courses are added to different GPAs for the student, the table must store a separate record for each division in the year and term.  Degree History  The Degree History table stores one record for each degree that a person has completed or is pursuing at your school. Faculty members usually have several Degree History records (to track both undergraduate and graduate degrees). Students may have one or more completed degree records. Current students must have at least one degree record that is in progress. You may store as many as 99 degrees per student.  The Degree History table is significant because it stores majors, minors, concentrations, certifications, and honors. If a student has more than one Degree History record, the system needs to know which record contains the student’s current division. The Student Master table contains a   Degree History Sequence #   column that indicates which Degree History record is current. You set the Degree History sequence number when you add or change a person’s degree history.  When you create InfoMaker reports, you can link the Degree History table to the Student Master table by using the ID number and the Degree History Sequence # columns. The InfoMaker report will use degree information from the current Degree History record.  Student Course History  The Student Course History table contains one record for every course taken by a student – in other words, the Student Course History table is the merging of student information and course section information. The student information provides the ID number of the student taking the course and the course section information contains the course section in which the student enrolls. The table stores each student’s courses on a year and term basis. Each student may takes as many as 99 courses in a year and term.  The Student Course History table provides the information for any processes related to individual student courses such as enrollment reports, grade tracking, grade reporting, and so much more.  Many functions in Registration depend on the Student Course History table for student course information. Therefore, if you need to locate any information about individual student courses, you will want to look at the Student Course History table. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  18  The Student Course History table contains records for preregistered student courses, current student courses, and graded student courses. These different types of student courses are identified by a  Transaction Status   code:     P – Preregistered     C – Current     H – History (graded and updated)     D – Dropped     W – Waitlisted     R – Reserved (used in conjunction with JICS)  Transfer of Course   Data  When working with course information, you will usually start by establishing your catalog, and then identify sections for each course in the catalog for a year and term. Now you are ready to register students for those sections.  Catalog information controls the creation of sections, and section information controls the registering of students.  Data flows through the course tables in a similar manner.  The primary flow of course information goes from  the Catalog Master table, to the Section Master table, to the Student Course History table.  You create sections based on courses in the catalog and register students for courses based on the sections that are offered.  Some columns in each of these three tables are similar. For example, a   Course Title   column exists on the Catalog Master, Section Master, and Student Course History tables.  Since the columns between the tables are similar, the programs that create sections and student courses can use these columns to provide default values. For example, when you create new sections, the program uses the course title from the Catalog Master table as the default value for the title on the Section Master table. You can change the title on the Section Master table, if necessary; however, most likely you will keep the default value. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  19  There are actually two flows of information:  When you create new course sections, the program uses the columns from the Catalog Master as defaults. If you do not see default values in these columns when you enter new sections, you can probably assume that you did not enter data in the columns on the Catalog Master table. The same situation exists when registering students – if you did not enter data in a column on the Section Master table, there will be no default for that column when you enter students.  D IVISION   C ODES  You can use division codes to identify the various levels of courses or students within Registration. For example, some courses are offered only at the graduate level, others are offered only at the undergraduate level, and others may be offered only in the continuing education division. Students and courses are both assigned to a division.  Course Division   As each course is created, assign a course division such as Graduate, Undergraduate, Continuing Education, or any other division your institution may consider necessary using the Section Master.  Student Division   A student is identified in the Student Master with a division code and this same division is then used in the Student Division Master.  The student division is used on the Student Registration window and NSC to determine part-time/full-time status. The student division is also updated by the Recalculate Academic Record process with the major, minor, and advisor ID on the Student Term Summary.  Transcript  Division  The transcript division that appears on the Student Course History is the same division that was identified on the Registration Configuration window.  During the configuration of Registration, you will need to decide whether the course division or the student division will be used as the default transcript division on the Registration Configuration window (see Registration Configuration   on page   21 ).  The transcript division is used during the Recalculate Academic Record process to calculate hours and GPA on the Student Course History. Courses will be grouped accordingly on the transcript. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  20  Chapter 4.   C ONFIGURING   R EGISTRATION  This chapter will provide details on accessing Registration and explain the set up and configuration options that are available.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand the available options for configuring and setting up Registration to fit your needs  U NDERSTANDING   C ONFIGURABLE   I TEMS  Select the   Registration Configuration   window. You will find four tabs: Registration Configuration, Configuration Table, Project Code, and User Column Config.  Registration Configuration Tab  Take a look at the first screen capture below to see some of the many configuration items displayed on this window – each numbered section is described in further detail below.  The default year and term that is identified here will be used for all registration processes.  Keep the current year and term in the default fields. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  21  Both the   Transcription Division and   Third Party Billing can be determined by either the course or the student depending on the radio button that is selected here.  When   Include In-Progress Courses...   checkbox is selected, the Student Course History table is checked during registration to determine if any in-progress courses meet either a prerequisite, corequisite, or prohibited requirement.  Select   Include Previous Terms in Corequisite Checking   to search previous years and terms – if not selected, the corequisite checking will be limited to only the current year and term.  If the   Use Add Corequisite Window   checkbox is selected, this window will appear when students select a course with a corequisite thereby allowing the student to make a choice and select the corequisite course.  When   Honor Census Dates and Assign Withdrawal Grades Automatically   is selected, the system will assign the current date to both the Withdrawal and Drop date columns and the grade code of   W   to the course row. The transaction status will remain   Current   until the academic update process is performed after which the course will be marked as   Withdrawn . If this checkbox is not selected, the registration process ignores the census date and students do not get   W   grades for dropping a course after the census date.  When   Honor Census Dates and Display Withdrawal Grade Window   is selected, the system will display the   Withdrawal Details Entry   window which contains details such as year and term, course ID, course title, withdrawal and drop dates (current date), and assign the   W   grade code. If this checkbox is not selected, the window will not appear; however, the grade will still be identified as   Withdrawn .  Calculate FT/PT Using Only Student Division   will limit the hours enrolled to courses that are in the student’s current division (determined by the current division on the Student Master table). If the checkbox is not selected, all courses regardless of division will be counted towards the part-time/full-time status.     If you choose this checkbox and are also using EX Advising, only the Student Course History rows where the Transcript Division is the same as the student’s current division will be used; otherwise, if this checkbox is not selected, all Student Course History rows will be counted regardless of division.  When selecting   Use Rules Based Update for PT/FT Definition , you must be sure that the PFS and PDF rules have already been defined.  When selecting   Use Rules Based Update for NSC PT/FT Definition , you must be sure that the PFN rule has been defined.  You may choose to perform an   Admissions Validation   in Registration with information that may already exist in Admissions by selecting one of the options displayed in the drop-down menu.  Select one or more checkboxes to include waitlisted students, students with holds, or display preferred name on any   Class/Grade Lists .

EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  22  You may choose to include a list of required textbooks for classes listed on a student’s schedule by selecting the appropriate checkboxes in the   Textbooks   section.  The letter identified for each   Day of the Week will print on all student schedules, class lists, and professor schedules.  You can configure the manner in which repeat courses are used within the registration process by choosing the appropriate options in the Treatment of Repeat Courses section.  Repeat process   Also referred to as   Repeat Update Type  Repeat flag based on   Also referred to as   Repeat Determina tion Code  Grade to use   Also referred to as   Repeat Processing Type  You can choose to recalculate and update the academic record immediately when grades are entered.  When the   Truncate Academic Record Results   checkbox is selected, all academic recalc functions that use a multiplication or division operation will truncate the results of that operation to the precision of the result column – that is, 2 decimals for quality points and 4 decimals for GPA. If you do not select the checkbox, rounding will occur and the result column will contain the rounded value.  If you are using the   Automated ‘Recalculate Academic Record’ process , you can setup the time between checks, see when the last recalc process ran, and see the number of students that need a recalculation. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  23  Depending on the selections that are made in the configuration, you can determine the amount of information that is printed on a Transcript including the course components themselves.  Use one or more of the text boxes to create messages that will be displayed on schedules, class lists, or grade lists.  The   Create Grade Maintenance Audit   checkbox will create an audit record in the Grade Maintenance History table each time a grade is changed.  Include Dropped Courses on Student Inquiry   will display dropped courses on the Courses tab of the   Student Inquiry   window – if this checkbox is not selected, only Current, History, Preregistered, Reserved or Waitlisted courses will be displayed.  The next configuration allows you to change the labels on any window or report that displays Division information by performing three steps:  Select the   Academic Credit Varies by Division   checkbox on the Registration Configuration window  1   Open the Division Definition window from Registration (you will now see the Academic Credit Label and Ratio columns) and enter the label you would like to appear rather than the word credit  o   In this illustration, the word “Units” will be entered in the Academic Credit Label column  o   You must also enter a Ratio for each division code since it will be used in the registration process to translate the academic credit appropriately when a student registers across divisions  2   Make sure that the Student option for the   Transcript Division Based on   has been selected (see Registration Configuration   on page   21 )  When you view a window that displays academic credit (such as the Student Inquiry window), notice that the word “Units” now appears in place of the word “Hours.” EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  24  You can change the census date on the Master 1 tab of the   Courses   window by selecting the  Allow Census Date Changes on Section   checkbox.  If you do not use census dates, do not select this checkbox and enter zero for the Census % in the Year/Term Definition window.  If you select the   Override Days of the Week   check box, you will be allowed to use a non -  standard code on the Section Schedule window. If you do not select this checkbox, the system will validate the value entered with the   Days of the Week   codes that have already been defined and display an error message when a non-standard code is entered. You can define new codes on the days_tim_ovrid column on   Maintain Table Values .  Identify the   Grade Scale   that will be used as the default when a new course catalog entry is created.  Used by the Scholarship or Special GPA feature, choose the   Residence Code   (defined on the Table Details table) that will be used to determine when a student is considered \"in state\" or \"out of state.\"  Utilized for state reporting purposes, the   FTE Divisor   calculates the number of full-time students enrolled at your school (510 represents the actual hours of attendance for a full-time student).  Choose the default component that will be used as a   Course Filter   when an inquiry is performed (by clearing the default on any window, you can easily change the filtering process).  The   Course Security   feature allows only certain individuals to update courses for which permission has been granted. The course security feature is honored on the   Student Registration, Courses, Grade Entry, Grade Changes , and   Student Course Details   windows. The two steps to follow for this feature are:     Identify any two course components     Identify the group and components for which security is granted  You may find this useful if you would like to allow department heads to enter grades only for those courses to which security has been granted.  For example, you may want to establish course security on the department and course number (components 1 and 2) as illustrated below. After you have entered these components on the Registration Configuration tab, you will need to define the groups that will have access to each component. In Registration, go to the   Course Security   window. The   Course Component for Security 1   column identifies the department and the   Course Component for Security 2  column identifies the course number. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  25  Select a group and then choose the components to which the group will have update  permission. In the example provided above, you'll see that the individuals who belong to the ART DEPT group will be able to update course numbers 002 from the Art department and individuals who belong to the ENGLISH DEPT group will be able to update course numbers 012 from the English department.  If you would like a group to have update permission for all courses, you would simply leave both course component columns blank.  This section identifies the use of the course components that have been defined on the   Course  Components   window. You can use as many as six course components to identify your courses.  In the print screen above, the course components have been defined as follows –     Component 1 = Department     Component 2 = Course Number     Component 3 = Section     Component 4 = Lab     Components 5 and 6 are not being utilized  Use the   Edit Mask   to determine how the course is displayed on reports. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  26  Catalog and Course Text Format allows you to edit catalog and/or course text in either text or HTML format.  If you are not using JICS, you will need to select Text Format.  If the majority   of your courses are offered online, select the checkbox to use distance education  as a default on the following windows when generating the IPEDS Fall Enrollment report:     CIP Definition     Catalog     Courses     Courses (Non-Traditional)  The Set “Distance Education” default to Yes checkbox is not used for any other purpose in the system.  If you plan to utilize the National Student Clearinghouse functionality, select the   Make Use of  NSC Functionality   checkbox to display menu options in Registration.  When the   Perform Cross Student Tables Updates   checkbox is selected, a window will appear when the   Entrance Year   and   Term   is updated on the   Student   tab of the   Student Information  window allowing you to update the Student Division Master and Degree History.  When the   Display Cross Student Table Updates Prompt   is selected along with   Perform Cross Student Tables Updates , you will also be able to change similar information that may be available on other tables.  The   Update Student Master PT/FT section contains two options.  You can choose the   Current Year and Term   which will update the number of courses, hours enrolled, part time/full time hours, and part time/fulltime status on the Student Master with the default year and term that has been identified on the   Registration Configuration   window. If you choose the   Most Recent Year and Term , this same information will be updated on the Student Master with the student term summary information from the most recent year and term in the student's record.  You can choose to display   Grade Notes in EX (on the   Grade Entry window) or in CRM Faculty through the   Grade Entry   portlet in JICS, in both locations, or not at all by choosing the appropriate selection from the drop-down menu.  Grade notes are defined as an attribute on the   Attribute Definition   window by using a code beginning with the letters GRD. After you have defined your grade notes, they can be associated with a student on the   Student Information   window by selecting the attribute and checking the  Show on Web checkbox as illustrated below: EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  27  Select the course components that will be displayed on the catalog, sections, textbooks, and majors.  In this example, the Section Master will use the first four components to represent each individual course section whereas the Catalog Master will only use the first two components, Department and Course Number.  Choose the appropriate radio button to determine whether prerequisite, corequisite, and prohibited courses will be validated against the course code or the Advising requirement code.  If you select the Advising requirement code, you must also have Advising requirement codes on all Student Course History rows and on all courses on the Section Master and Section Schedules for which the validation will occur.  Use the check boxes 1-6 to identify the components that will be used for comparison purposes.  If you have purchased the   Scholarship or Special GPA license, this checkbox will appear allowing you to turn on the functionality. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  28  Configuration Table Tab  Depending on the option that is selected for over-enrollment, additional configurations will be available on the   Registration Permissions   window. After clicking one of the radio buttons, you will need to save this configuration and then open the   Registration Permissions   window for further configuration.  This checkbox will determine if you want a warning when registering for a course that does not contribute to the student’s program.  Selecting this checkbox will allow you to set the number of times a student can attempt a course before triggering a warning or a stop.  You can set the number of credit hours of developmental course work a student can attempt before triggering a warning or a stop.  If you want to use the Education Success Requirements, you can select the checkbox and choose the first option if you only require one course in any type of Education Success area (for example: Math or Reading, or Writing) or you can choose the second option to require one course in each type of Education Success area (for example: Math and Reading and Writing). EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  29  Selecting the Dual-Enrollment Term Credit-Hour Limit checkbox will allow you to set the number of dual enrollment credit hours a student can attempt in a given term before triggering a warning or a stop.  If your school has a limit for the number of classes a student may withdrawal from you will want to set the number of withdrawals allowed, choose whether the system will trigger a warning or a stop, and decide if the system will track withdrawals from their entrance year/term or for a specific year/term.  You may want to require a reason for a withdrawal. You can choose if you want a reason to be provided, and then determine cutoff dates.  When using the census date as a cutoff date for withdrawals, you can choose to disable the drop button on the Drop Course Settings prompt.  If you have purchased CRM Student or CRM Faculty, you will be able to configure the manner in which a reserved course is handled. A reserved course indicates that some other type of approval or payment is necessary before a student is actually approved for a course and placed in Current status. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  30  If you have purchased CRM Student or CRM Faculty, you will be able to configure how child courses are displayed in JICS. You may also identify the default value for online grading – this default can be changed if you select specific individuals for grading rights in JICS.  When the   Use Course Authorization  checkbox is selected, students who have not met a requirement or are registering for a course that is full will still be able to register for the course if the proper authorization is granted.   The authorization reasons will need to be defined on   Maintain Table Values   as illustrated in the screen capture above.  When you select the   Display Citizenship Questions in the portlet checkbox, the citizenship questions will appear in the Ethnicity and Race portlet in CRM Student in JICS. You also have the option of changing the text to display for the citizenship questions.  In the   Ethnicity and Race Settings for the Ethnicity and Race Portlet you can determine which items students will be required to enter in the Ethnicity and Race portlet of the CRM Student in JICS. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  31  Project Code Tab  When you are licensed for the State Reporting feature, the   Project Code   tab allows you to assign and control the project code and identify the manner in which they are utilized within Registration.  The course request number, which is automatically generated by the system whenever a new section is created, can also be used as the project code if the   Generate Project Codes Using the Course Request Number   checkbox is selected.  A prompt will be displayed if the project code is not identified when the   Prompt for Project Code on the Courses Window   checkbox is selected.  To copy the project code from the source course to a new course, select the   Copy Project Code in the copy Course Process   checkbox.  You can assign permission for certain groups to work with project codes by selecting the  Application Group ID   from the Available section and click the   Add   button to move the group into the Selected section. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  32  Chapter 5.   U NDERSTANDING THE   M ASTERS  This chapter will explain some of the components on the Master windows in Registration by explaining the purpose and intent of the information.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Recognize each of the windows that display the Master details     Understand how elements relate to each other     Realize the impact of specific configurable components within the main areas of the registration process  S TUDENT   M ASTER  The Student Master has a one-to-one relationship with the Name Master – the one component that separates them is the identification of a division. Therefore, once you have initially established a person in the Name Master, you will need to assign a division in the Student Master. Since the Student Master is the first entry point in registering a student, you will want to be sure that you identify as much detail as possible about the student in all of the columns that are displayed on the Student Master.  Click the   Extension button in the upper right corner of the window to display cohort, GRS, and scholarship details (this information is stored in the Student Master Extension table). EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  33  The   Current division is used by the transcript, IPEDS, and NSC. You can also create individual  Groups   – Graduate, Undergraduate, All, etc. This allows you to generate grade reports or transcripts for individual divisions or all divisions. You must have a division group even if you only have one division – both can have the same name.  Entrance Year and   Term is extremely important for both IPEDS and NSC reporting purposes. When you enter a year and term, the   Cross Table Student Information Update   window will be displayed as shown below:  This indicates that data in other tables and columns may be affected and you have the option to determine the tables and columns that will be synchronized by clicking on the appropriate checkboxes. The date that appears is the begin date for the default year and term which is used as the entry date on the Student Division Master and the Degree History. The same process is used for anticipated grad year – that is, it will be determined by using the end date for the default year and term.  The   Cross Table Student Information Update   window will appear if both the   Perform   and  Display Cross Student Table Updates   checkboxes were selected during configuration. See Registration Configuration   on page   26 .  The   Group Reg code associates the student to a group of predetermined courses. Applying a  Group Reg   code that has been defined on the   Group Registration Definition   window allows you to automatically register the student in all required courses.  If you are utilizing the   Group Registration   feature, this is the window where the code is identified with the student.  T he   Tel/Web   code represents the web registration group of the student. The   Tel/Web   code is  used to determine the dates and times for each group’s web registration period so students can perform registration via the Course Schedules portlet in JICS.  Every student MUST be identified with a   Tel/Web   group when utilizing online registration.  The   Cluster   option is a code that defines a particular group of students and can be associated to  the charges process in Accounts Receivable. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  34  The   View/Add   Additional Holds button provides access to the   Student Holds window.  A hold can prevent registration, online registration, printing of official transcripts, grade reports, etc. and can also be configured to display a warning. You may also use holds to tag certain students.  For complete information on holds, see   Chapter 7: Understanding Student Holds   on page   63 .  These hold columns should be   view only as holds should be maintained using the   Student  Holds   window.  The   Honors,   Probation, and   Class can be selected from the available options in the drop down menu. However, you can also use a rules based update to populate these columns.  The   Location that is selected here does not prevent students from registering to another location – you can use this location to group students or identify the campus location.  Residency   is used for the state reporting functionality – otherwise, it has no other relationship.  You may want to post final exam scores using different ID numbers for security purposes. In this case, you can generate random ID numbers ( Generate Test ID   window) which will then appear in the   Test ID   column on this window.  The   Athletic Team Member   checkbox can be used to generate reports but it is not used for any other purpose.  If you are licensed for the Special or Scholarship GPA, the   Eligible for Scholarship   checkbox must be selected so that all local classes will be applied towards the scholarship.  The data displayed in the   Matriculation section will be imported through the Admissions to Registration Transfer process. When you click the   Add   button, the student’s ID number is added to the   Role Membership   window with a   Role ID   of student.  The college attendance information can be entered manually or imported using the Admissions to Registration Transfer process.  If the   Calculate FT/PT Using Only Current Student Division checkbox was selected on Registration Configuration   on page   21 , the   Part Time/Full Time   section will display current information for the student; otherwise, the most recent information from the last academic recalculation will be displayed.  You can track a person's eligibility to return to your institution by selecting the   Eligible checkbox. However, if this box is unchecked and the student wants to return to the school, the student will not be prevented from registering for classes.  The   High Schoo l Graduation Date and   Type can be entered here or the information can be imported through the Admissions to Registration Transfer process. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  35  The financial tab holds details on Billing Settings and Third Party Billing. You can also edit the Student Term settings for billing and maintain student billing exceptions.  In most cases, your business office will use the   Discount and Tuition   codes when student charges are generated.  The Student Term Table tab gives you an overview of the Student Term Table; however, you cannot add rows on this window.  S TUDENT   D IVISION   M ASTER  The student's academic record is stored in the Student Division Master for each division. Therefore, if a student has taken both graduate and undergraduate courses, an academic record for each division will be found in the Student Division Master.  Identify the current division on the Student Master – when reports are generated, the Student Division Master and Student Master can be joined by name and current division so that the appropriate information is included in the report.  Although similar information is also displayed on the Degree History, any changes made on the Student Division Master will not automatically update the same information on the Degree History.  The   Division displayed here is the same as the Student Master; therefore, you can create a rules based update to change both columns.  The original   Entry Date is taken from the entry year and term. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  36  You can indicate if the student is a new college student or a transfer student as well as the student’s entering year into your school. The   First-Time Year and Term   from the Division Master is used for IPEDS reporting.  Exit Date is displayed here as well as on the Degree History – both are independent of each other. However, if you make a change in one, a popup will appear so you can choose to synchronize both at the same time.  Ce rtification can be entered here or on the Degree History – both are independent of each other.  The   Class Level   displayed here is the same as the Student Master; therefore, you can create a rules based update to change both columns.  You can assign   Advisors to a student either on the Student Division Master or through EX Advising. Advisors assigned to a student in EX Advising will not be transported into Registration.  If you need to assign more than three Advisors, use the EX Advising product to do so.  You must populate the   Expected Graduation Year and   Term especially for National Student Clearinghouse and IPEDS reporting purposes.  The most recent academic update will reflect the student's hours in this section. Local work will be displayed in both the   Local   and   Career Hours   columns. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  37  D EGREE   H ISTORY  Similar to the Student Division Master, one record for every degree that a student is pursuing will be saved in the Degree History. A student may have more than one Degree History record – right-click on the   Degree   window displayed below and choose the   Select Degree History Record   option. This allows you to view all of the degrees for a student with their respective sequence numbers.  The left side of the   Degree History window shows all degrees a student has completed and any active degrees the student is currently working towards. This section allows you to view and edit the same information as the   Select Degree History   record option in a convenient location.  You must have one record that is identified as the   Current Degree. Even though a student may have multiple active degrees, only one degree can be current.  If the   Non-Degree Seeking   checkbox is selected, the current degree will also be non-degree seeking.  The   Active   checkbox identifies those degrees that a student is currently pursuing; therefore, it is possible to have multiple active degrees.  You can use the   Student's Intent   field to indicate what the student originally wanted to pursue when entering your school.  The   Academic Degree   field is only used for tracking purposes and does not print on the transcript. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  38  Many of the   Degree Dates fields have been imported from information that was entered on other tables.  This section is divided into three tabs: Degree Programs, Graduation, and Graduation Stage.  On the   Degree Programs   tab, the   Major ,   Certification , and   Minor   information is very important for IPEDS reporting purposes and will be displayed on the transcript.  The   Graduation   tab contains information that has been imported from other tables. The   Class Rank   will compare the division, classification, and GPA. If 8 students are in a class and all students earn a 4.0 GPA, all students will be identified with a Class Rank of 1.  The   Graduation Stage   tab contains details on a student’s progress towards degree completion. This window will provide student tracking from graduation requirements to ordering graduation gowns and completing a degree.  The   Advising Institutional Requirement Year connects Registration to Advising.  If using the   Degree Cross Reference   to automatically establish aims, this feature will compare the major, minor, or certification with the institutional requirement year in Advising to determine the aims that are assigned to the student. Therefore, this connection is critical. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  39  C ATALOG   M ASTER  The Catalog Master is organized by Organization Code – this means that you can maintain catalog information on courses from other schools as a way to retain records of transcript equivalencies. The illustrations below will concentrate on describing the information that is displayed on the   Course Attributes   tab.  All of your institution’s courses should be placed in the *LOCAL organization.  For schools that have multiple campuses, the   Location   field can be used to distinguish on which campus the course will be conducted. If you always use the same location for a specific course, identify the location here on the Catalog Master so the data will flow down to the Section Master.  The   Course D ivision is required. You may want to use the   Instructional Division as a method to group courses for reporting purposes; however, it is not required.  For each course offered at your school, select either   Credit hours or   Clock hours and indicate whether a course is offered with a   Fixed   number of credit/clock hours or a   Variable   number of credit/clock hours.  Most traditional courses are offered with a fixed number of credit/clock hours, while courses  such as music lessons, special topics, or internships are often variable. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  40  If a course has a fixed number of hours, enter that value in the   Credits   or   Clock   field and click the Tab key – this will cause the system to enter that same value in the   Max Credits   and   Min Credits   columns.  If the course has a variable number of hours, enter that value in the   Credit   or   Hours   field and then enter the   Maximum   and   Minimum   number of hours as well.     With variable hour courses, some schools prefer to set the default hours to be the same as the minimum hours and then make adjustments in the Section Master when the course is created or when individual students register if more than the minimum is needed.     Other schools set the default hours to be the same as the maximum hours and again make adjustments in the Section Master when the course is created or when individual students register.     You can also set the default hours to 0.00 and then adjust the hours for each student when registration occurs.  Consider each option carefully based on your most frequently used policy and procedure.  Also consider your accounts receivable policies and procedures. For example, if you set the default to the maximum, will students be charged too much money thereby requiring a refund or will the minimum require an adjustment that increases the work performed by your accounts receivable office?  By identifying this default on the Catalog Master based on your most frequently used policy, the adjustments you need to make either to the Section Master (when the course is created), the Student Course History (when student registration occurs) or to the student's account will be minimized.  When this checkbox is selected, the Lab Repeatable section below will become editable and the values identified will determine how repeats are handled with lab courses during the registration process.  If your school creates the main course and the associated lab course from the same Catalog Master row, you will want to select this checkbox. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  41  The   Course Repeatable and   Lab   Repeatable flags are used during the registration process to determine if the student may register for any given course or lab more than one time.  Hours Allowed for Degree   is the number of hours that may be accumulated towards the student’s degree for the course or lab.  The   Times May Be Taken   value is used during the registration process to determine if the student is exceeding the allowed limit for how many times the course or lab may be taken.  Enrollment Defaults – the   Minimum Enrollment does not impact anything in the system; however, you can use it to keep track of this number. The   Maximum Enrollment   value is the limit for overenrolling a course. Once this limit has been met, no additional students can be  registered for the course - regardless of the end users   Course Full   permissions on the  Registration Permissions   window.  If the Maximum Enrollment value is 0.00, you will not be able to exceed the Course Capacity value.  The   Grade Scale is required data for the Catalog.  Both the   Grade Scale   and   Credit Type   values can be changed for the specific course at the Section Master level.  You can always edit   Date Approved whether the course is marked   Active or not. Even if a course is not marked as   Active , you can still add it to the Section Master.  If using the Special or Scholarship GPA feature, you will need to select the   Add to Special GPA   checkbox.  The Catalog   window   is used to define all of the courses that a school has to offer   –  similar to a printed catalog. The Courses window is used to define instances of the catalog in specific semesters or terms. Most schools add a 'section' for each instance of a course. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  42  S ECTION   M ASTER  One of the first differences you will notice from the Catalog Master is that the Section Master is associated with a year and term. The illustrations below will concentrate on describing the information that is displayed on the tabs.  If any field is blinking when you click on the Master 1 tab, this is an indication that the course number was entered incorrectly or your catalog row is missing information; therefore, verify your Catalog Master.  The information displayed on the left side of this window is the same information that was already identified on the Catalog Master.  Identify the   Lead   Instructor for this course section, which will automatically appear on the  Schedule   and   Faculty   tabs.  The   Advising Requirement is an eight character code representing the course. The code used typically corresponds to a catalog course number. Each course must be assigned an Advising Requirement Code so that it can be represented in the advising system.  Course Reminder   also appears on the Catalog Master. While this information is not displayed, you can use it more as a scheduling tool. For example, if a course always needs to be in a room with a projector or cannot be taught on Tuesday, you can place these details in the   Course Reminder   field. If the detail is defined on the Catalog Master, the information will flow down to the Section Master. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  43  The   Project Code   is used by the Business Office to track information in the Transaction History  table. See Registration Configuration   on page   31   for more details.  A   Request Number   (unique ID number for the course) is automatically generated as courses are created in the Section Master.  You can indicate whether a course is   Cross - Listed with another course by identifying a parent or child association. In this case, you will need to build the parent course before the child and always cross list both courses.  Every course is automatically marked as a parent using its own course code.  The   Enrollment   Controls section will display the status of the course as well as the   Course  Capacity ,   Maximum   and   Minimum Enrollment .  The   Status   will adjust according to registration information and you will be able to manually change the numbers in order to accommodate your needs for each new section.  The   Allow Waitlisting   checkbox is only available if you are configured to use the waitlist functionality. See Registration Configuration   on page   28 . This checkbox provides a way of allowing or not allowing the waitlist process at the course level.  When creating a new section, the   Dates that have been identified for the year and term on the Year/Term/Subterm table will automatically be placed in the date fields displayed on the left. When you make a change to the   Begin Date   and   End Date   on the   Schedule   tab and save, those date values default to the   Master 1   tab   First Begin Date   and   Last End Date .  If the   Allow Census Date Changes on Section   checkbox was selected on Registration Configuration   on page   23 , the   Census Date   will be editable.

The date information on the   Schedule   tab is stored in the Section Schedules table.  Select the   Days of the Week for your course. For the   Friday Options, you can choose every Friday, odd/even Fridays, or no Fridays.  Identify the   Place for the class by choosing the   Location,   Building, and   Room in that order from the Room Master.  Rather than printing the days of the week on the Student Schedule, Professor Schedule, and Room Schedule reports, you can identify   Days Override   options such as Independent Study, Music Lessons, or By Arrangement. See Registration Configuration   on page   23 .  If you identified a   Meeting Type   on the   Master 2   tab, the same information will appear on this tab.

W ORKING WITH   S TUDENTS  This chapter will provide information related to students and their courses.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Recognize all of the components on the Student Registration window     Register students     Define and utilize the group registration feature     Understand the criteria used to distinguish the difference between a dropped and withdrawn course     Enter student grades  R E GISTERING   S TUDENTS  The process of registering one or more students for one or more courses can be performed on the  Student Registration   window. While the ability to register students is consolidated, you will want to become familiar with the many features and understand all of the options that are available. The illustration that appears below will walk through the entire process of registering a student. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  51  You can perform registration either by student or by course – select the appropriate radio button. In the example here, we will use the   Student   option.  If for some reason the student has a   Warning   or   Hold   assigned to them, a window will appear indicating where the warning or hold exists. At this time, you can choose to   Override   the hold and continue with the registration process. You may also click the   Prompt Later   button, which will continue to produce this window whenever you register this student for additional courses.  Enter or select the student ID number that exists in the Name Master (right-click and perform an  Advanced Search   if necessary).  Information from the most recent academic update will be displayed for the student if they already exist in the system and have taken classes.  A tree view will identify every course (including transfer work) that the student has taken sorted by year and term.  Click on the + to expand the year/term and view each course that was taken by the student.  Detailed information for the selected year and term will be displayed in the center of the window. Use the scroll bar at the bottom to view additional details that are available including part time/full time, division, credits, credit type, repeat status, tuition hours, grade scale, Special or Scholarship GPA (if licensed), Advising requirement code, instructor, location, and schedule information.  The large red   E   that appears in the left column indicates that an error occurred during the registration process – possibly a prerequisite that was not met, a course conflict, or a repeat issue. Right-click on the large red   E , select the   Error Summary Report , and view the error information.  You can also perform 'drops' and 'withdrawals' from this section by changing the   Status   (click on the field for a specific row and a drop down menu will provide a list of options).     If you select   Delete Course , all information about the course will be removed for the student.     If you select   Dropped , historical information will be retained and the system will compare dates. If the current date is past the census date, the course will be considered a Withdrawal. If you do not want this to happen, change the drop date to something prior to the census date and it will be processed as a dropped course.  You can view/add notes or actions on the student's notepad by clicking on the   Notepad buttons.  You may want to generate charges directly from the Registration office which can be done by clicking on the   Generate Charges   button. However, you will need to set this up in the business office as well. In this case, the year, term, and transaction date is critical. Discuss this option with your business office to determine the policy at your school. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  52  Either the default   Y ear/Term from Registration Configuration or your personal default year and term (identified on the   Control   tab) will appear in this section.  Students registered on this window will be identified as a Local Detail   Record Type . However, you can also enter transfer courses and, in this case, change the record type.  Always use the *LOCAL   Organization code when registering students at your school.  Click the   Search... button to view the Section Master and all of the courses that are available for the selected year and term.  When you locate the courses for which the student needs to register, click the   Add   checkbox and then click   OK .  You will receive a message if a situation exists that prevents registration from occurring. For example, the message below indicates that the census date has passed for this course. You may click   OK   to override the message and allow registration to occur.  You may also receive another type of message that indicates the course selected has been identified with corequisites that have not yet been taken. In this case, you can also add the student to the corequisite courses. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  53  When the   Student Registration   window reappears again, click the   Register   button.  All of the courses that were selected for the student will now appear on the Student Registration window under   Select Courses for Registration .  You can now make individual changes for this particular student or remove courses, if necessary. You can also register students by simply clicking on the   Course Code   drop down arrow and selecting the courses which works well if a student has a list of courses and you can easily locate them from the drop down menu.  Notice the three sub-tabs on the right of the   Student Registration window.     Student Course Details   will give you access to all of the columns stored in the Student Course History table for the course that has been selected.     Inquiry   will allow you to see all of the student's courses – somewhat resembling a transcript. The bottom of the window displays the Student Term Summary by Division which captures information from every division and term combination in which the student was registered.     Scholarship GPA   (if licensed) will display every year and term in which the student earned credit for the courses taken.  Now click on the   Manage   tab from the   Student Registration   window – this is useful for performing mass actions. You can withdraw a student from all classes or move all preregistered students to current status by using the   Set Status   button. Click the   Update Registrations   button and the process will change each course/student in one action. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  54  This feature is great when working with several students at the same time. You can also use the  Retrieve Criteria   sub-tab on the right to access a customized query and perform a mass action – for example, create your own query in InfoMaker and the query will be displayed in the drop down menu.  Now click on the   Control   tab from the   Student Registration   window. You can set your own personal preferences by selecting a year/term, display order for course status, a default of Drop or Delete for the  Manage   tab, show sub-tabs, etc. Click the   Save Control Values   button. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  55  The next time you access the   Student Registration   window, your selections will be displayed.  D EFINING   G ROUP   R EGISTRATION  You can effectively utilize the group registration feature when students need to take specific courses in a specific sequence.  To begin using group registration, you will need to start by defining   Group Registration   codes. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  56  Define the group code on the left side of the window and choose one of the following:     Method 1 – continue defining the group code by selecting the courses (by year and term) on the  Group Registration Definition   window     Method 2 – associate a course to a group on the   Section Master   window  In the example provided above using Method 1, the GRS Courses Student group is required to take certain courses – therefore, these courses will be associated with the GRS code. After your groups are properly defined, you will be able to attach the group code to the student.  In this example, assign the GRS group registration code to the student. When you access the   Student Registration   window, the following message will appear:  If you respond   Yes   to this message, all of the courses that have been associated with the   Group Registration   code for the specific year and term will be copied into the   Student Registration   window as displayed below: EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  57  You can also use a Rules Based Update to assign the group registration code to more than one student.  Rather than assigning courses to group registration codes on the   Group Registration Definition  window, you can use Method 2 – that is, create your group registration codes and then assign them to specific courses on your Section Master.  As you build your Section Master, you can define your groups by assigning the appropriate group registration code to the course.  Processing Group Registration  After your groups are clearly defined, you are ready to perform the actual registration.  You may use a customized query through InfoMaker or simply select the   Group Registration Code   from the drop down menu.  A student is only assigned to a group – not a year and term. You may use different codes every year but if you plan to use the same code year after year, you will need to remove the group registration code from the student's record after registration has occurred. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  58  C ENSUS   D ATE  The Census Date is used to identify when a course is determined to be either a withdrawal or dropped course for the student.  When you define your years and terms, you can use the   Census Percent   to determine the   Census Date  for a specific section of the course. When a census percent is entered, the system determines the duration of the term by identifying the number of days between begin and end dates for the term and places the resulting date in the census date field.  The census percent can be used if your school policy considers a course to be withdrawn after a certain percentage of time has passed within the term. On the other hand, if your school policy uses a specific date after which courses are considered to be withdrawn, you can enter an approximate percent and continue to let the system calculate the census date until the desired date appears. This is the recommended approach to use rather than simply entering a census date.  In the screen capture above, the 2012 FL year/term began on 09/05/2012 and ended on 12/13/2012. When 10% was entered as the census percent, the system calculated that 10% of the duration of time between begin and end dates was 09/15/2012; therefore, this date was placed in the census date column.  When a Section Master record is created, the system automatically calculates a census date for the section by using the same formula identified earlier by using the earliest begin and last end date on the section schedule.  When you always allow the system to fill in begin and end dates from the Year/Term/Subterm table, all of the courses for the term will have the same census date. If you have courses with different begin or end dates, then the courses will also have different census dates. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  59  If the census percent on the Year/Term/Subterm table is blank, the census date will default to the earliest begin date for the section.  Drops vs. Withdrawals  A course that is withdrawn will be assigned a grade and remain on the Student Course History table for the student. A course that is dropped will not appear on the Student Course History table for the student. Let's examine some parameters that impact the manner in which this process behaves within Registration.  From the   Control   tab on the   Student Registration   window, you can define the default that will be used on the   Manage   tab of the Student Registration window.  The   Census Date   on the   Master 1   tab of the Courses window is used to determine whether a course is considered to be a 'drop' or 'withdrawal' status when a registered student is removed from a course. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  60  From the   Registration Configuration   window, you can choose to immediately assign a Withdrawal date or display the   Withdrawal Grade   window when a student drops a course.  Scenario 1  If the default on Student Registration is set to Delete and the student drops the course before the census date:     the row is deleted from the database  Scenario 2  If the default on Student Registration is set to Delete, the student drops the course after the census date and neither configuration checkboxes have been selected:     the row is deleted from the database  Scenario 3  If the default on Student Registration is set to Drop and the student drops the course before the census date:     the course is dropped, transaction status is set to D, and the system date is used as the drop date  Scenario 4  If the default on Student Registration is set to Drop, the student drops the course after the census date and the Honor Census Date and Assign Withdrawal Grades Automatically configuration is selected:     the course is withdrawn (a W grade is assigned), transaction status is set to H, and you can change the drop date  Scenario 5  If the default on Student Registration is set to Drop, the student drops the course after the census date and both configuration items are selected:     the Withdrawal Grade window appears where you can select a W, transaction status is set to H, you can change the drop date, and you can select the Drop flag  Scenario 6  If the default on Student Registration is set to Drop, the student drops the course after the census date and neither configuration has been selected:     the transaction status is set to D, the system date is used as the drop date, and the Drop flag is selected  Scenario 7  If the default on Student Registration is set to Drop, the student drops the course after the census date and the Honor Census Dates and Display Withdrawal Grade Window configuration has been selected:     assign the Withdrawal grade and no further changes are allowed EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  61  You can drop a course ( Student Registration ) using either the   Manage   tab or the   Registration   tab.  On the   Manage   tab, you can identify a set of criteria that is applied to the course when the Drop status is selected.  From the   Registration   tab, you can right click to   Student Course Details . When changing the status to Drop Flag on the   Course   tab, you may change the drop date that is compared with the census date. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  62  E NTERING   G RADES  Grades are usually entered in the Registration system during specific times of the year – such as midterm or final.

U NDERSTANDING   S TUDENT   H OLDS  This chapter will provide information that can be used to define and apply a ‘hold’ to a student record indicating that a specific situation exists for that student.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand how to configure and setup the holds feature     Define various types of holds that are specific to your purpose     Apply a hold to a student record     Identify the impact that each hold will have on the student’s ability to register, request a transcript, or receive grade reports     Recognize the windows where these student holds can be viewed  D EFINING   H OLDS  What is a hold? You can identify individuals that exist in the Student Master to indicate that a problem exists with the student’s record. Holds can be defined so that the student receives a warning message when a certain process is performed. A hold can also prevent a student from performing an action such as registering for classes, receiving a transcript, or viewing grades online. Basically, you can define the characteristics of each hold depending on your institution’s policies and needs.  Before you can assign a hold to a student, you will need to identify the three main components for each hold:  Type   Is the hold assigned to the student for academic, disciplinary, or financial reasons?  Access   Who is able to view and apply a hold to a student?  Definition   How will the hold affect the student? EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  64  As you begin to build your specific holds, it is important to recognize the order in which the three components need to be identified. The illustration below will explain the sequential order.  Access the Hold Setup window containing three tabs – this resembles the same three components discussed earlier:  Hold Type  Hold Type Access  Hold Definition  In comparison, the diagram above and the three components that need to be setup can be equated to the following:  Categories   =   Hold Type  Groups   =   Hold Type Access  Codes   =   Hold Definition  The   Hold Type   allows you to group and organize all of the hold codes that your school will be using such as Admissions, Accounts Receivable, Library, and Registration. The hold types are also used to identify the access that will be provided to application groups – that is, you will be able to allow one group to work with only the Accounts Receivable and Registration hold types.  Step 1   Step 2   Step 3  Create the   categories  that you will use, such as financial, disciplinary, academic, etc.  Identify the   groups who will be able to view, add, or remove each type from a student’s record  Create   codes associated with a category and group, then define the actions that will occur when a hold is assigned to a student EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  65  1   Click on the   Hold Type   tab from the   Hold  Setup   window  2   Right-click on the lower portion of this window and select the   Add Row   option  3   Enter a code of no more than 10 characters  4   Enter a description of the hold type  5   Select the   Active   checkbox to be able to use this type  If you remove the checkbox from the   Active   column, you will no longer be able to select this hold type for a student and the following message will be displayed:  6   To remove a hold type, right-click on the row and select the   Delete Row   option  You will not be able to delete a hold type once it has been associated with an Application Group.  Now that your types have been defined, you can begin to identify those groups who will have access to each one. The access level (assigned to groups, not users) will control the information displayed on the  Student Holds   window.  Security for holds is based on the hold type and Application Group IDs; therefore, you will need to determine the application groups who will be able to access each type of hold.  7   Click on the   Hold Type Access   tab from the   Hold Setup   window  o   Choosing the Tasklist Groups radio button will display details on the group selected EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  66  8   To add a row that will identify specific access for a group, click  The Admin access level includes all of the other functions as well as deleting the hold from the student’s record.  Caution should be used when assigning Admin rights because deleting a hold removes the history of the hold from the student and database.  9   Save your information and return to the   Hold Type Access   tab – you will see the group identified with the hold types and the respective access level  10   Select a group and click on the   User   radio button to view information for specific members of the group  o   You cannot change any information – this is a ‘view’ only mode EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  67  Now that you have defined your hold types and identified the groups that will have access to each hold type, you can create your hold codes.  11   Click the   Hold Definition   tab from the   Hold Setup   window  12   Right-click and select the   Add Row   option  Let’s take a close look at the details displayed – since there is so much information on this tab, the screen captures below have been separated for illustration purposes.  Enter a two character code to identify the Hold  Enter text to describe the Hold  Associate the Hold with a Hold Type if you want to enforce the access given on the   Hold Type  Access   tab  If you do not select a Hold Type, all individuals who have access to the Student Holds window will be able to add, view and remove the hold.  When you hover over the   icon, bubble text will display all users who have at least View access to the Hold Type associated with the specific Hold Code.  This text will be displayed to the student, advisor, or parent on JICS portlets. This information will also appear on the   Student Holds   window in the EX application and is editable.  This is the information that will be seen by Advisors and those who do not have permission to view a hold. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  68  The checkbox will determine if the hold is displayed on the following portlets: Advisee Roster, Course History, Course Schedules, Grade Report, Unofficial Transcript, View My Students  You can choose to inactivate a hold so that it does not appear in the list when adding a hold to a student  The   Hold option will prevent registrations from occurring either through the EX application or online.  The   Warning   option will prevent a student from registering online unless the Allow Web Registration checkbox is selected.  None   indicates that the hold does not impact registration in any way.  The   Allow Web Registration checkbox becomes editable when a Hold Code has been defined as a Warning and, when selected, will allow online registrations to occur in spite of the warning.  Hold will prevent students from viewing their Unofficial Transcript online unless the   View  Unofficial Transcript   checkbox is selected.  Warning   will prevent students from viewing their Unofficial Transcript online unless the   View Unofficial Transcript   checkbox is selected.  None indicates that the Hold does not impact the transcript in any way.  This column displays only when your school is licensed for CRM Student. If the checkbox is selected, a student who has a Transcript hold or warning will be able to view their transcript online in the Unofficial Transcript portlet.  Grade Report hold will prevent students from viewing their grades online in the Course History and Grade Report portlets. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  69  This column displays only when your school is licensed for CRM Student. If the checkbox is selected, a student who has a Grade Report hold will be able to view their grades online in the Course History and Grade Report portlets.  You can associate a hold with an Action or an Action List that will be displayed on the   Student  Holds   window. Upon saving the hold, the Action or Action List will be added to the student’s Notepad.  You can also select a default Remove Action or Remove Action List. When you remove a hold from a student on the   Student Holds   window, a stop will be placed on the Action or Action List on the selected Remove Action or Remove Action List.

R ECALCULATING   A CADEMIC   R ECORDS  This chapter will explain the process for recalculating a student's academic record.  O BJECTIVES  At the end of this chapter, you will be able to:     Understand and perform the process of updating a student's academic record     Recognize the tables that are affected by the update     Identify the impact of repeat courses and how the GPA is affected  E XPLAINING THE   M ANUAL   U PDATE  Academic records are automatically updated every five minutes. You can set/change the parameters for the auto recalculation on the Registration Configuration window.  If you want to run a manual recalculation (for instance, you may want to run the Update Advisor and Degree Information process for a specific year/term snapshot) you can use the   Recalculate Academic Records   window. Below, you will see an explanation of how the update works.  A student's academic record is organized by divisions.  When a student takes a course in more than one division, each set of cumulative hours and GPA calculations are saved for each division. Course work across divisions is never combined together.  The recalculate academic record process can be performed in the following situations:     When a grade is entered  o   You can configure the update to occur as soon as a row is saved in the   Grade Entry  window only for those students for which data has changed.  o   See Registration Configuration   on page   22 .     When a grade changes  o   You can change a   History   status grade on the   Grade Change   window at which time the system will automatically update the student's academic record. If you also mark repeat courses on this window, the student's Student Course History will identify the repeat course and the forgiven course.     When transfer work is identified  o   You can enter or update course information for transfer students on the   Transfer Entry  window. As soon as you save the record, the recalculate academic record process is performed. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  72  What happens when the recalculate academic record process is performed?  Information in both groups below is saved:  Group 1   Group 2  Student Master   Student Term Summary  Student Term Summary by Division  Transcript Header  Student Subterm Summary by Division  Student Division Master  Student Midterm Summary  1   The Student Course History is also saved and sorted by year, term, and subterm  2   Any row in the Group 2 tables that does not have a corresponding Student Course History row is deleted even if the information is not yet considered ‘history’  3   New rows are created in the Group 2 tables for which a Student Course History row exists except ‘summary’  4   A snapshot is taken of the degree, major, minor, and advisor columns on the Student Term Summary by Division table  If the   Update Adviso r and Degree  Information   checkbox is not selected on the  Recalculate Academic Record   window, the snapshot columns are updated in memory.  When both the   Update Advisor and Degree Information   and   Overwrite Existing Information   checkboxes are selected on the  Recalculate Academic Record   window, the major, minor, and advisor information is updated on the student's current division (notice the default year and term will be displayed when the checkbox is selected) on the Student Term Summary by Division table and the current date/time will be stamped on the snapshot date column for these fields.  The degree, major, and minor columns on the Degree History table are marked as the current degree. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  73  R EPEAT   C OURSES  Students may wish to repeat a course that has already been taken to achieve a higher grade.  The repeat course process is determined by the selections that are made on the Registration Configuration window. Refer to Registration Configuration   on page   22 .  You can easily remove the Course Repeatable flag on the Catalog Master for individual courses that are not allowed to be taken by a student more than once.     Repeat Update Type   can be automatic or manual. This configuration does not impact the calculation of the GPA but rather relates to whether the system will automatically identify the repeat course or if you will need to manually flag a course as forgiven (*) or if the course is to be counted in the GPA (R).     Repeat Determination Code   allows you to identify the repeat by course components or by the requirement ID.     If using the automatic repeat process option, you will need to also identify the   Repeat Processing Type   by selecting either the Best or Most Recent.     Forgive Courses with * from * until R   – this configuration will allow a repeat course to be forgiven in the GPA totals for the year and term that has a repeat flag of * and in every Student Term Summary by Division row following the * year and term. All courses from the time of the forgiven * course until the R course are forgiven. If this checkbox is not selected, the course will not be forgiven until the year and term in which the course is repeated and meets the criteria of Best or Most Recent grade to use – the forgiven course will be counted against the student until the year and term in which the student has an R in the repeat flag.     Forgive Repeat Courses in Term Hours, Term GPA   – this configuration will forgive a repeated course in the Term Hours and GPA columns on the Student Term Summary by Division table. The Recalculate Academic Record process compiles the academic history and forgives a repeated class based on the first three configuration settings mentioned above. If you use the Automatic Repeat update types, each repeated course is compared and an R is placed in the repeat flag of the course with either the Best or Most Recent grade; an * is placed in the repeat flag of the repeat courses with the lowest or oldest grade indicating that this course no longer contributes to term or cumulative GPA calculations.

Whether the repeat process is automatic or manual, the R will appear.  2   A match for MAT147 was found regardless of the fact that the section numbers differ between the terms – this is due to the fact that only components used in the course catalog determines how the repeat flag is based.  After registration, nothing happens with repeated courses until grades and entered and the Recalculate Academic Record process is run according to the following steps:  3   If the repeat update type is manual, the repeat flag is not changed on the Student Course History.   If the repeat update type is automatic, the process moves to the next step. EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  75  4   The academic recalculation process then looks at the repeat processing type.  o   If Best Grade is used, the repeated courses are compared and the R is placed in the repeat flag of the course with the highest grade (determined by the Grade Priority column on the grade table). An * is placed in the repeat flag of the repeated course with the lower grade.  o   If Most Recent Grade is used, the R remains in the repeat flag of the repeated course in the current term (which is the most recent course). An * is placed in the repeat flag of the previous repeated course.  o   In either case, the * indicates that the repeated course has been forgiven and the repeated course contributes to term or cumulative GPA calculations in a special way.  5   The academic recalculation process uses a flag in the Registration Configuration to determine how forgiven courses are handled.   If the   Forgive * from * until R   is selected, the GPA is recalculated for the term that includes the first (or oldest) forgiven course, no longer including the hours and quality points for the forgiven course.   The GPA is then recalculated for every subsequent term because the forgiven course causes cumulative GPA totals to change for each term.

EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  81  Identifying Candidates and Criteria  Before beginning this process, you may want to create a Transfer user with function security granted for the   Admissions to Registration Transfer   window. In this way, any person processing this transfer can log in as Transfer user and automatically be granted the appropriate permissions.  The process of   pushing   data from Admissions into Registration or   pulling   data into Registration from Admissions consists of a multitude of options. These options will allow you to identify the exact data that will become part of the student's degree history record.  We highly recommend that you create smaller sub - sets of groups on which to perform  the transfer process, which will provide you with more control over choosing the correct options.  Go to   Admissions to Registration Transfer  1   On the   Select Candidates   tab, select an existing Transfer Profile or create a new one by entering a name and clicking the   Save As   button  o   The profile will be saved as a user preference  2   Choose one of the elements (year and term, stage, division, program, etc.) on which the query will be performed EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  82  3   Click the   Retrieve Candidates   button  4   The   Selected Candidates   radio button will be selected in the Query Options section and a list of all candidates who meet the criteria will be displayed  5   If you would like to further define the criteria, click on the   Change   button EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  83  6   In this example, you can select one or more rows and click on the   Remove   button or use the drag and drop feature to move candidates from the Selected section to the Available section  o   Your change options will vary depending on the criteria chosen – therefore, if you chose Stages as your element, this window will allow you to remove stages rather than candidates  7   Click   OK  8   Once you are satisfied with the candidates that have been selected for the transfer, click on the   Transfer Process   tab EX Registration Learning Guide  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  84  Take sufficient time to understand each of the checkboxes that are available on this window as they will determine the information that is transferred into Registration and the tables that will be updated.  If a match is found in Degree History for the current candidacy's major program, a new record will be   Inserted   or an existing record will be   Updated   in the Degree History table, depending on the checkboxes that have been selected. You can select both options.  When a checkbox is selected, the Student Master will be updated with the information from Admissions.  If you are also using EX Student Life, there is no need for you to identify the   Resident Commuter Status   here (on the Student Master).  If you are not using EX Student Life, you can use this checkbox to bring over the   Resident Commuter Status   into Registration.  The ID number, Division, Degree (only if not completed) and Degree Earned at *LOCAL will be updated accordingly if the appropriate radio button is selected.  A new row is added to the Degree History regardless of the rows that currently exist when  Always Add Degree   is selected.  An existing Degree History   IS   updated when   Update Existing, Add New Degree   radio button is selected and the existing degree   IS   NOT   updated when   Ignore Existing, Add New Degree  radio button is selected. If either case, when no match is found, a new row is inserted.

If it does not  exist, a new row is inserted in the Degree History table.  When   Make New/Updated Row Current   checkbox is selected (and in addition to the other options in this group), any row updated or inserted is set as the Current Degree for the candidate ID. If this checkbox is not selected, the Current Degree does not change for the candidate ID.  This checkbox is only available if you are licensed for EX Student Life.  When the   Resident Commuter Status   checkbox is selected, you must also identify a session.  The   Resident Commuter Status   and   Session   information is written to the Student Life table titled stud_sess_assign.  You may choose a cluster on which the Rules Based Update will be processed and view the status in the Application Log File. Rules that are used by the selected RBU Cluster are defined on the   Update Results and Rules   window.  Select the   Entry Date checkbox and enter a date to update the Student Division Master.  If   Expected Grad Year/Term   is selected, you will need to enter the year and term here. If at least one row exists in the Student Division Master but not for this particular division, select the checkbox to insert a   New Row for New Division .  Select the   Entry Date checkbox and enter a date to update the Degree History.  Select   Degree   and   Major/Certification/Minor   to update the Degree History table.     You will need to map these three programs on the Program Definition window since Admissions does not use the same majors, certifications, and minors that have been defined in Registration.  If   Expected Grad Year/Term   is selected, you will need to enter the year and term here.  Only available if you are licensed for EX Advising, you can use the   Adv Institutional Req  checkbox to update the Advising Tree Year Code in the Degree History table and create aims for the selected Major or Certification.  If you have the Student Life module, this is where you can you can select the Resident Commuter Status (that will be updated on the Student Master table) and choose a session.
