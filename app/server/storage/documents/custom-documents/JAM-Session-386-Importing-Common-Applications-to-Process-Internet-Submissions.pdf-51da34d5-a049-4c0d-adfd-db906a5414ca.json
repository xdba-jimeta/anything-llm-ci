The New Way: Out of Common Application © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     The Admissions User exports the files using a custom export we created, marking them as “exported” (to prevent duplicate entry).  The New Way: Out of Common Application © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     The file is saved as “commonapp.xml” on a shared drive.     After this, we’re ready to open up JICS!  The New Way: Out of Common Application © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     On JICS, the Admissions User access a Feith Forms iQ Form we created called, “Common Application XML Import”     Even though we did this next part with a Feith Forms iQ Form, you could probably find another tool to do something similar.  The New Way: Through JICS © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     The web form starts very simple, as just a white page with a button that says, “Upload Common Application”     When the button is clicked, the form grabs the raw XML from the downloaded file on the shared drive and submits it to Jenzabar EX.  (And so on...)  The New Way: Through JICS © 2015 Jenzabar, Inc.     The Admissions User then finds a row in Process Internet Submissions for each application (up to 100 at a time), and works from there!
