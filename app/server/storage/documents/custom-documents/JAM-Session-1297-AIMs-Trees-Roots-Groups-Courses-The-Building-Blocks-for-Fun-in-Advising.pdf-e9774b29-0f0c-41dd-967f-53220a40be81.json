June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Presented by: Christopher Lovett, Ph.D.  Mount Aloysius College  June 4, 2016  #1297 AIMS, Trees, Roots, Groups & Courses: The Building Blocks for Fun in Advising © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     To share our successes, trials, and tribulations with various aspects of the Registration and Advising modules.     Hopefully, to learn a little from you!     To fill up your tool bag with a couple new tricks (or new projects to implement).  Objectives for the Session © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Mount Aloysius College  •   an accredited Catholic, co-educational, private college  •   enrollment approximately 1,300 full-time students, male and female, residents and commuters; approximately 1200 part-time undergraduate, graduate, continuing education and dual enrollment students  •   sponsored by the Religious Sisters of Mercy  •   career and liberal arts education  •   193-acre campus  •   Went live with Jenzebar EX in January 2009. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Our Jenzabar EX advising was set up by the previous Registrar the year prior to going live.     The College implemented modules for the Controller’s Office, Student Life, Admissions, Registrar’s Office, and Student Advising.     The implementation was successful, but.......     The Advising module did not get as much attention as it needed.  Implementation © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  THE BUILDING BLOCKS  AIMS, Trees, Roots, Groups & Courses © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Advising Tree Issues © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     A total rebuild of majors and roots occurred.  The Tinkering and Rebuilding Began © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Our majors all consist of:  •   Core Courses  •   Major Courses  •   Other Required Courses  •   Free Electives     AIMS for all occasions:  •   Minors  •   Concentration  •   Specializations  •   Options  •   Honors Curriculum  •   Certificates  Using AIMS © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     16 credits of course work over 4 years  Honors Program © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     We have specializations that are usually a choice of 5-6 classes to achieve 12 earned credits in that specialization.  Working in Groups © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     The headache of allowing courses to meet more than one requirement  •   Core – Major  •   Core – Cultural Diversity Requirement  •   Core – Minors/Concentrations/Specialization  Lessons with Priorities     Priority and Allow Reuse  •   All is well and good until you start allowing other variables into the mix.  •   For example, AR 109 it can be used to meet:     Art Minor     Expressive Arts for Healing Minor     Core Humanities Requirement     Core Cultural Diversity Requirement © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Rule of Thumb for Priority and Allow Reuse  •   Minors/Concentration/Specializations are Priority #1 with Allow Reuse check  •   Upper level group requirements or groups with smaller numbers of selections are Priority #2 with Allow Reuse un-checked  •   If it needs to be used in another requirement area after the Priority #2 use, I substitute the course for itself. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  CREATIVITY WITH REPORTS  The fun never stops with.... © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     As a result of breaking down all the degree components in to their own AIMS, we have instant access to student GPAs in any active AIM. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     We have a rule for bachelor degrees: Every student must earn 30 credits at the upper level with 18 being in the major.  Course Types and Report  Courses  Lower Level   Cumulative Lower Level  Upper Level  Cumulative Upper Level © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Doing so allowed us to begin to tally and count the completion of upper level credits for students.  Graduation Report  Advising Worksheet  I recommend setting up Maintain Program GPA Profiles  One Issue: In progress counts the course twice if being used for two requirements. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Problem: Our remedial courses where be counted in the totals for graduation hours when institutional policy stated they were to be counted only for yearly aid progress, but not towards the 60 or 120 credits need for graduation.  •   Advisors missed subtracting them from totals  •   The result were a handful of students every summer who thought they were graduating, but in reality needed a credit or two to reach the required minimum for the degree.     Solution: The development of a RM (Remedial) Credit Type to be assigned to the developmental courses.  •   Allowed for the inclusion in semester/term totals  •   Allowed for the exclusion in the cumulative totals and on the advising worksheet  Remedial Courses and Transcripts © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Advising Worksheet     A shortcoming is that the credits are not removed from the graduation report, as it does look at credit type when calculating credit totals. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Sometimes the little things make the biggest impact.....  Student Schedules © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  A COUPLE OTHER THINGS WE HAVE DISCOVERED AND INTEGRATED © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     The college offers a handful of certificates at both the undergraduate and graduate level  •   Almost two year battle when reporting program level enrollment through the NSC reporting process     Certificate programs that did not share a CIP code with another major worked fine.     Certificate programs that shared a CIP code with another major did not work.  Certificates and Program Level Reporting © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     A non-related request led to an “AHA” moment. © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort     Financial Aid requested we add an agreement to the start of each semester registration to remind students of Pell requirements and balancing face-to-face and online courses.  Populate Term Agreements © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.   June 1 - 4, 2016 Gaylord Texan Resort  Registration Group Information © 2016 Jenzabar, Inc.
