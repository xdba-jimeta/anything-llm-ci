Function and Purpose of  Priority   and  Reuse   in Jenzabar  7  A numeric   priority   code is used to evaluate requirements that appear more than once at the same level in the institutional requirements.

Courses  13     Different majors or aims can have a common group of courses for example “Business Administration” and “Accounting” or “General Education and Major”.     Check “ allow reuse ” because same group and courses required for multiple majors and same priority.     The same course may be an option in several groups within the major.     Uncheck “ allow reuse ” because the course can only be counted once and set different priorities. Common group, different major  14 Multiple Groups, Same Course  15  Priority is the same BUT reuse is only checked on the Elective course group Continued  16 Same course, different aim  17  PSY 1010 General Psychology can be used in the General Education Aim and Psychology Major Aim. Double major, double trouble!  18  Student who chooses to double-major may have some restrictions in regards to counting the same course for more than one requirement."}},{"id":"c3467d64-d63a-4b2e-8c25-459d75a37c50","values":[0.008283509872853756,-0.05095578357577324,-0.006468854378908873,-0.03569229692220688,-0.03578132018446922,0.032463133335113525,-0.05625835433602333,-0.04165429249405861,-0.013387243263423443,-0.020037533715367317,0.019362233579158783,0.01360267959535122,-0.017174283042550087,-0.00603713421151042,0.05659639090299606,0.010477003641426563,-0.026939090341329575,-0.030604012310504913,-0.045350633561611176,-0.014206313528120518,0.055952321738004684,-0.02675534598529339,0.013195556588470936,-0.06271166354417801,-0.006288500968366861,-0.05186839401721954,-0.02311704494059086,0.021522698923945427,-0.0007139358203858137,-0.08634262531995773,0.011462059803307056,0.03603237867355347,0.06706646084785461,0.014097862876951694,-0.007585988845676184,-0.02592797763645649,-0.04495333880186081,-0.040136974304914474,0.06759199500083923,0.03898552060127258,-0.05455392971634865,0.01386084035038948,0.025152910500764847,-0.05485084280371666,-0.07413803040981293,-0.028073033317923546,-0.06905404478311539,0.011008350178599358,-0.0020093205384910107,0.044159114360809326,0.004275027196854353,-0.019056404009461403,-0.08246021717786789,0.011257226578891277,0.006267629563808441,0.07851487398147583,0.00024155323626473546,0.037680357694625854,-0.06859537959098816,-0.03690547123551369,-0.10542216897010803,-0.000023031981982057914,-0.039223745465278625,-0.006352332886308432,-0.030602846294641495,-0.009748566895723343,-0.005633413325995207,0.025711076334118843,-0.054256144911050797,0.030625153332948685,0.06483660638332367,-0.05949326232075691,-0.017144188284873962,-0.02217365987598896,0.05478908494114876,0.009651675820350647,-0.03450106829404831,0.10090434551239014,-0.023942574858665466,-0.03566811606287956,-0.026373257860541344,0.01224985159933567,-0.07350508868694305,-0.012109226547181606,0.0035522477701306343,-0.06709236651659012,0.009964706376194954,-0.026613064110279083,-0.03148671239614487,0.07764855027198792,0.055616386234760284,-0.07817832380533218,0.028918802738189697,0.026601267978549004,-0.01504699606448412,0.04850847274065018,-0.05187954381108284,0.020711122080683708,-0.0018409020267426968,-0.012194161303341389,-0.08674878627061844,0.004577449522912502,-0.03021734021604061,0.04653233662247658,-0.020417630672454834,-0.0765705481171608,0.019874148070812225,0.024438301101326942,0.07443036139011383,-0.059346769005060196,0.06081506982445717,0.04926242306828499,0.003908867947757244,-0.00911792740225792,-0.014161704108119011,0.03396422415971756,0.10280951112508774,0.07917670160531998,0.08226807415485382,-0.007420883979648352,-0.016473248600959778,0.021494630724191666,0.005807144101709127,-0.08981538563966751,-0.02220877818763256,-0.06360142678022385,-0.07720165699720383,9.118003316113301e-33,0.029877658933401108,-0.00716764759272337,0.002242145361378789,0.003487327368929982,-0.020993342623114586,0.057527460157871246,-0.07964519411325455,0.0175958089530468,-0.07791632413864136,0.027425983920693398,-0.00039706489769741893,0.08803623914718628,0.062060315161943436,-0.005675942171365023,0.014419032260775566,-0.11444976180791855,-0.004475718829780817,0.04679204896092415,0.04842870682477951,-0.04186927527189255,0.00010551417653914541,0.0893707349896431,-0.04611249640583992,-0.11901146918535233,0.022539597004652023,0.03427297994494438,0.07867022603750229,0.05487151816487312,0.055553995072841644,0.015058065764605999,0.03687791898846626,-0.04156813025474548,-0.07375895231962204,-0.005929979030042887,0.016789212822914124,0.10288934409618378,-0.034657761454582214,0.009294052608311176,0.05350476875901222,-0.08966557681560516,-0.05499463900923729,0.07680272310972214,-0.04211133345961571,0.045273710042238235,0.012875261716544628,0.01845291070640087,0.04503225162625313,-0.008520756848156452,0.11282042413949966,-0.03480490297079086,-0.05959036946296692,-0.0749257281422615,0.1232972964644432,-0.03698762133717537,-0.017946133390069008,-0.05676959082484245,0.07766402512788773,-0.021028755232691765,-0.06717541813850403,-0.019976768642663956,0.006227288395166397,0.06546370685100555,-0.0009194507729262114,-0.002661394653841853,0.003835805458948016,-0.008288768120110035,-0.09149104356765747,-0.05872739478945732,0.08931726962327957,-0.034102559089660645,-0.015996219590306282,0.00450274720788002,0.014770358800888062,-0.03341180086135864,0.02892383001744747,0.054106004536151886,0.010045215487480164,0.04318074882030487,0.028372110798954964,-0.03003125637769699,-0.0348086841404438,0.010115905664861202,0.031807705760002136,-0.011661680415272713,0.0008734011789783835,0.04030826687812805,0.06616459041833878,0.06685161590576172,0.020845262333750725,0.0852801576256752,0.011477089487016201,0.07217271625995636,-0.03430589288473129,0.11216112971305847,0.05044000968337059,-9.134524889214108e-33,-0.006786184851080179,0.03455812856554985,0.0619526281952858,0.08197325468063354,0.05851009488105774,0.03675262629985809,0.03227697312831879,-0.11208194494247437,0.03130270168185234,-0.018675632774829865,0.031007200
