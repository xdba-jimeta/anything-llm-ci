EX Quick Guide: Reporting for NSC   8  J e nz ab ar L ea rn i n g & De v el o pm e nt  U SING   EX   FOR   NSC   R EPORTING  Jenzabar EX Registration provides automated functions for generating the reports you send to NSC. NSC's definitions of some data they want may be different from the way you define those items, which may include full time/part time status and enrollment status (withdrawn, leave of absence, etc.). Registration helps to translate your data into NSC data.  NSC reports provide enrollment data and status for all enrolled students (with the exception of excluded individual students). EX Registration provides the required enrollment data, which will then be matched via Social Security Numbers (SSNs) to the loan data on file.

When using EX to transmit your data to NSC, there is a four-step process.  1   Ensure all of your tables in EX are setup and configured properly  2   Prepare your data then check your prepared data for inconsistencies, and missing or incorrect information (correct as needed)  3   Create your final files  4   Send your files to the National Student Clearinghouse via the FTP  Use the following guidelines when creating NSC reports:     Include all data for a student under a single ID #     Students are identified through the NSC by their Social Security Number, so the correct SSNs must be

Please complete all the steps below to rule out what the culprit may be.     1   Take the transmittal file (.TXT file) and log into NSC’s website to see if you  can FTP the file to NSC outside of the EX registration module.   Instead of logging into EX Registration to FTP, you’re going to log into NSC’s website and try to FTP this way.   If you’re not sure how to FTP the file on NSC’s website, then contact your NSC representative and ask for assistance.  o   If you   CAN   successfully FTP via NSC’s site, then this tends to indicate there is no firewall or network issue with your institution being able to FTP. Proceed to step #2.  o   If you   CANNOT   successfully FTP via NSC’s site, then make sure you used a valid login/password provided by NSC. This also tends to indicate a firewall and/or a network security issue.

A CCESSING   NSC   W INDOWS IN   EX  You will find the windows necessary for NSC reporting in the   Reports- National Student Clearinghouse   Activity Center.  There are several setup and configuration windows you may need to setup or update; however, unless this is your first time running NSC reports, most of the tables should already be configured.  Sometimes, especially if you are a new user or you recently upgraded to a newer version of EX, you may not be able to see all of the NSC windows in your Activity Center. If that happens, and you usually have access or you think you need access, you should contact your Activity Center Manager to gain access to all of the NSC Reporting windows.

there are a few additional windows in Registration that you will need to set up prior to running the NSC reports.  Window   Description  CIP Definition   This window allows you to add and maintain CIP codes that are used by the U.S. Department of Education to generate federally mandated reports. You must select the Used in Regulatory Reporting checkbox for each CIP code for which the U. S. Department of Education requires you to report statistics. Each major or certification offered by your institution must be associated with a CIP Code, as this association is needed for the Enrollment and Completions reporting.  Major/Minor  Definition  Each student is associated with a set of codes that represent majors and minors. Valid major and minor codes with their descriptions are defined on the Major/Minor Definition window. You must define a code for each major and minor that may be associated with faculty/staff or past students.

Three-Quarter Time Upper Limit   Part-Time/Full-Time Definition window  NSC Configuration  The first step in the process is to populate the appropriate values in the   NSC Configuration   window. Because NSC reports group individual student records by FICE and Branch codes, every student record must have the correct codes.  In this window, you will designate the FICE codes and Branch Codes, then indicate if it is a default branch that will be used when generating new student records for NSC. Many schools only have one FICE/Branch designation and will report all students under the same codes. If our school has multiple FICE or Branch codes, you should enter the most common codes as defaults and correct the data records of those students who need to be reported under alternate codes.  If you do not have multiple branches, the Branch code should be “00.”  The FTP site’s DNS Name for NSC will come pre-populated in this table.

Degree Periods are used to:     Identify the actual commencement or graduation periods on the Degree History window and allows organizations to identify every graduation period within one academic year.     Identify the NSC Degree Periods for which the records are being submitted. A Degree Period can include multiple graduation periods to accommodate organizations that submit data to NSC once a year but have multiple graduation periods within that year.  Degree Periods cannot have overlapping dates.  When the final transmittal file is created by the NSC Degree Verification process, the Period Code column is updated on the Degree

Since The National Student Clearinghouse is a third party, institutions need to exclude those students from the information submitted. This is done using the NS7 Clearinghouse FERPA Block Indicator Update Rule.  On the   Results Definition   tab, the resulting code of ‘Y’ will automatically populate because this process will update the NSC_DEG_VERIF_DETAIL.FERPA_BLOCK with a ‘Y’ if the student has indicated they do not want their information released to a third party.  On the   Results Rules Definition   tab, you will be looking for the name_master.is_ferpa_restricted column (this is the checkbox on the Name Master window).

If you want to see a list of students who have a Balance to Date greater or equal to a set amount, you can create a rule on the NS8 – Clearinghouse Financial Block Indicator Update Rules that will indicate a financial block.  Since the Business Office hold (which is financial) is entered into the student_master.hold_1_cde, this is the column you will use to validate a financial hold.  The example rule above is written to validate that this column IS NOT null, and when the rule is run, it will validate that this column is not null so the financial block will be placed on the student’s information for Clearinghouse.

reporting, you will need to identify a  class for each student (such as freshman, sophomore, etc.), but because you are able to define your own class codes on the  Classification   window, Jenzabar

No data maintenance in or data retrieval from the Financial Aid module will occur for the NSC report.  EnrollmentVerify enables you to refer any commercial enrollment verification request to the Clearinghouse for secure, immediate response.  If you have the Advising module up and  running with Advising Trees, and you perform these steps, you will be able to calculate Program Enrollment Statuses.  If you do not own the Advising module, you will have to devise a manual method of collecting students’ program enrollment statuses for NSC Enrollment Verification reporting.

The two most likely causes for a blank status are:     Either the student does not have a current division entry or the division code does not match a record on the NSC Part time/Full timetable. There must be a record on the NSC Part-time/Full- time table for each possible combination of Division and Term.     The NSC Enrollment Status table does not have a record that matches the Special Status value stored for students on the Student Data file. This may happen if you used a mass maintenance to fill in the Special Status.

This includes any student who does not have a valid Social Security Number.  Any student without a Social Security number (SSN) is excluded from the Transmittal Files. The   NSC SSN Exception Report   will list any students processed who have no SSN and also checks for duplicate SSNs. Only the first student with a SSN is included on the Transmittal File and counted in the totals. The other students with the same SSN are reported on the SSN Exception report. It is important that you verify the data on the NSC SSN Exception Report and correct any SSN problems in your files.  If you have only a few errors, you may want to correct the records manually from the NSC Transmittal (Header, Detail, and Trailer) Records windows; otherwise, you will have to re-run

Once the *FREE Bucket is MET (through When Met Then Met), then any courses that don't fit the other trees, and no longer fit in *FREE, would then no longer be counted toward the student's program.  Q:   I understand the process wil l be looking at Majors/Certifications, but will it be looking at the  Concentration field as well?  A:   Yes. If the Concentration is associated with a Major in the Concentration Definition window, then when the Major Aims are gathered, the Aims for the associated Concentration will be added and the process will check to see if the courses contribute to the student's program.  Q:   If a student is only enrolled in credits applying to their minor, are they considered eligible  for financial aid?

Degree History row, then the courses contributing to the minor will not be evaluated for inclusion in eligible hours.  Q:   What will be best place in EX to see what NSC enrollment status has been reported?  A:   When you have collected data for an NSC Transmittal File, then you can see the information in the NSC Transmittal Detail window. After you have generated the text file that gets sent to NSC, then you can see what was reported in the NSC Transmittal History window.  Q:   We keep every past degree as “active” even aft er graduation, and simply add a new row if  the student returns for an additional degree. Can we keep this process, or do we need to change the way we handle “active” degrees?
