A tip is a trick or   helpful hint that you may not know, but could help make your daily job and  tasks easier and/or better.  A warning is a cautionary message that a certain change or click could have consequences in  your system.  A bomb is an extreme warning, letting you   know that whatever step or change you are about  to make would impact or cause irreversible changes to your entire system.  An example is a storyboard or step - by - step (usually including images) that will show you how  and why you would complete a process.  A key icon will let you know that the window/feature is limited by special permissions.

This planning process takes the program curriculum set up by the Advising Module Manager and turns it into academic plans that can be used by advisors and advising students to map out which courses need to be taken to satisfy the requirements of their selected set of aims (e.g., major, minor, J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Academic Planning Guide   7  certification, Gen ED, etc.) and when. Plans can be copied from one year/term or sub-term to another and updated as needed to save time repeatedly re-entering planning information. Advising worksheet defines what the student needs to take and academic planning determines when they need to take the courses.  J1   D   ESKTOP   S   ETUP FOR   A   CADEMIC   P   LANNING Institutional requirements trees must be set up in J1 Desktop before you begin to utilize J1 Web academic planning. The requirements trees define what curriculum a student needs to take in order to graduate and academic plans lay out when the student will take the courses. To make the curriculum available for planning in J1 Web, there are several steps in J1 Desktop that need to be completed. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Academic Planning Guide   8  •   Step One: Set up institutional requirement trees to manage the aim requirements and academic planning details. To indicate the curriculum isn't completed, the select   Building trees   on the   Options  tab for each root requirement being developed.  •   Step Two: Once the trees are set up, update the requirement status to   Prep tree for plans   ( Options  tab). This enables the   Academic Plans   tab where academic planning information can be entered. The   Academic Plans tab is only available when the requirement is a required course or a group that has an OR relationship and is the last child in an AND ancestry string.  •   Step Three: Verify the requirement trees are tested and accurate. If the requirement trees are inaccurate, academic plans will be inaccurate and student progress will be impacted. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Academic Planning Guide   9  •   Step Four: Make the requirement tree ready for associating with a degree/aim for cross reference by selecting   Ready for Degree/Aim Cross Reference   from the   Options   tab.  •   Step Five: Associate the requirement tree with a degree/aim.  Degree/aims designated as   Not ready for plan appear in the Program Planning block to let Advising Administrators know the institutional requirement trees have not been finalized. Detailed information about setting up institutional requirement trees and creating the degree/aim cross reference is available in the J1 Desktop Online Help.  A   CTIVATING   A   CADEMIC   P   LANNING In order for J1 Web academic planning to be implemented, the Advising Module Manager must activate it from the Advising Settings. Academic planning can be activated in two modes:  •   Setup   allows Advising Administrators to build plans without making them available to advisors and students. Advising Administrators can build plans, share them with others, update them appropriately based on feedback, and designate them as ready to be published, but they cannot publish them. This ensures plans are not associated with students and advisors cannot access them until they are ready. Once your school is confident the plans are ready, you can switch Academic Planning to   On .  •   On   allows Advising Administrators to build plans and proceed with publishing them to make them available to advisors and students. Advising Administrators can build plans, share them with others, update them appropriately based on feedback, designate them as ready to be published, and publish them. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Academic Planning Guide   10  Activating academic planning is a permanent configuration that impacts J1 Desktop and JICS workflows. Once it is activated, it cannot be deactivated. The process significantly enhances the advising process and to fully utilize the features in the Advising Administration and Academic Advising hubs, it is recommended your school activate academic planning. W   HAT IS THE   D   IFFERENCE BETWEEN   S   ETUP AND   O   N   ?  Setup   On  Create draft plans        Share draft plans        Update draft and shared plan layouts        Designate plans as “ready to publish”     Publish plans    J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Academic Planning Guide   11 J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Academic Planning Guide   12  W   HEN   A   IM   R   EQUIREMENTS   C   HANGE When any updates are made to curriculum/requirement count for a program, minor, certification, or concentration in J1 Desktop, impacted academic plans now go into a “Needs Review” status.  Your   Department Chair discovers a higher - level English course was left off the English program  and must be added even through the plan has been published and students have started mapping out their courses. Adding the course impacts the default plan and any English majors who are following it. When such curriculum updates are made, Advising Administrators must update the default plan and continue with the planning process for the plan. This varies according to the status of the plan when the curriculum was updated and if your school is in academic planning setup mode which has extra steps before plans can be published. U   NDERSTANDING   P   LAN   S   TATUSES  •   Draft   means program requirements are still being assigned to the plan layout.  •   Shared   means the program requirements have been assigned to the plan layout and the plan has now been shared with other stakeholders for review before publishing and making it available to advisors and student advisees. Updates can still be made.  •   Ready to Publish   means the requirements have mapped out to the appropriate years/terms. If needed, the plan has been shared with other stakeholders such as department heads and updates have been made, if needed. The plan is ready to be published and made available to advisors and students. If your school is using setup mode, you will not be able to publish plans until academic planning is turned fully on.  •   Published   means the requirements have been laid out in the plan and the default plan has been published and is available for advisors to use with their student advisees.  •   Needs Review   means updates have been made to a requirement tree and the plan may be impacted. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Academic Planning Guide   13  D   RAFT AND   S   HARED   P   LANS The process for curriculum updates to ‘draft’ and ‘shared’ plans varies from the process for ‘published’ plans. Since plans haven’t been published, updating the layout doesn’t impact advisors or students. If the plan was shared before the curriculum was updated, it can be shared again once the needed updates to the plan layout are completed.  •   If a program requirement is removed, the Edit Plan Layout shows a notification that requirements need to be removed from the plan and the option to delete requirements appears on the Edit Plan Layout page.  •   If a course, group, or cumulative course is added, the new requirements appear as unplanned requirements on the Edit Plan Layout page. J1 Web 2019.4 – Advising Academic Planning Guide   14  P   UBLISHED   P   LANS The process for curriculum updates to ‘published’ plans varies from the process for ‘draft’ and ‘shared’ plans. Since plans have been published, updating the layout impacts advisors or students. The plan must be re-published and students are immediately considered “off plan.” Advisors are notified and can work with their students to remove courses, assign or select new or different courses, and potentially move requirements to different time periods.
